All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “estimate,” “target,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potentially,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.

Table of Contents


Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including risks described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K may include additional factors that could harm our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have filed as exhibits to this report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
Investors and others should note that we may announce material business and financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (investors.snowflake.com), our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), webcasts, press releases, and conference calls. We use these mediums, including our website, to communicate with investors and the general public about our company, our products, and other issues. It is possible that the information that we make available on our website may be deemed to be material information. We therefore encourage investors and others interested in our company to review the information that we make available on our website.

SELECTED RISKS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS

Investing in our common stock involves numerous risks, including those set forth below. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Below are summaries of some of these risks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized.
•We have experienced rapid revenue growth and have a limited operating history, both of which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.
•We may not have visibility into our future financial position and results of operations.
•We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
•General market conditions, volatility, or disruptions, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, bank failures, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, could have an adverse impact on our or our customers’ or partners’ businesses, which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.
•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
•If we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
•If we are not successful in executing our investments in our platform, including artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, or AI Technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
•If we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.
•We could suffer disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies.
•We expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price could decline.
•Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform. 
•Sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations, such as longer sales cycles and more complex customer requirements.
•Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, reductions in cloud spending, or lower than expected consumption, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.

PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS

We believe that a cloud computing platform that puts data and AI at its core will offer great benefits to organizations by allowing them to realize the value of the data that powers their businesses. By offering rich primitives for data and applications, we believe that we can create a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. 
Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful insights, apply AI to solve business problems, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. 
Snowflake solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, and create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure. 
Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case’s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 40 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.
Our platform supports a wide range of workloads that enable our customers’ most important business objectives, including data warehouse, data lake, data engineering, AI/ML, applications, collaboration, cybersecurity and Unistore. From January 1, 2024 to January 31, 2024, we processed an average of approximately 4.2 billion daily queries across all our customer accounts, up from an average of approximately 2.6 billion daily queries during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year. We are committed to expanding our platform’s use cases and supporting developers in building their applications and businesses.

Architecture

Our platform was built from the ground up to take advantage of the cloud, and is built on an innovative multi-cluster, shared data architecture. It consists of three independently scalable layers deployed and generally connected globally across public clouds and regions:

Table of Contents


•Centralized storage. The storage layer is based on scalable cloud storage and can manage structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It can be grown independently of compute resources, allowing for maximum scalability and elasticity, and ensures a single, persistent copy of the data. The stored data is automatically partitioned, and metadata is extracted during loading to enable efficient processing. 
•Multi-cluster compute. The compute layer is designed to capitalize on the instant elasticity and performance of the public cloud. Compute clusters can be spun up and down easily within seconds, enabling our platform to retrieve the optimal data required from the storage layer to answer queries and transform data with optimized price-performance. This functionality allows a multitude of users and use cases to operate on a single copy of the data. 
•Cloud services. The cloud services layer acts as the brain of the platform ensuring the different components work in unison to deliver a consistent user-friendly customer experience. It performs a variety of tasks, including security operations, system monitoring, query optimization, and metadata and state tracking throughout the platform. 
This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 40 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected through our Snowgrid technology to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a global and consistent user experience.

Our Technology

Innovation is at the core of our culture. We have developed innovative technology across our platform, including managed service, storage, query capabilities, compute model, data sharing, global infrastructure, and integrated security.

•Managed Service

◦High availability. Within a region, all components of our platform are distributed over multiple data centers to ensure high availability. Hardware and software problems are automatically detected and addressed by the system, with full transparency to our customers. 
◦Transactions. Our platform supports full ACID compliant transactional integrity, ensuring that data remains consistent even when our platform is concurrently used by many users and use cases. 
◦Data availability and recovery. Our platform provides customers the ability to replicate data across various deployments, create point-in-time consistent snapshots of data, and view or recover deleted or changed data over a configured period of time. This allows customers to avoid difficult trade-offs between high recovery times, data loss, or downtime.
•Storage
◦Columnar data. Our platform stores data in a proprietary columnar representation, which optimizes the performance of analytical and reporting queries. It also provides high compression ratios, resulting in economic benefits for customers.
◦Micro-partitioning. Our platform automatically partitions all data it stores without the need for user specification or configuration. It creates small files called “micro partitions” based on size, enabling optimizations in query processing to retrieve only the data relevant for user queries, simplifying user administration and enhancing performance. 
◦Metadata. When data is ingested, our platform automatically extracts and stores metadata to speed up query processing. It does so by collecting data distribution information for all columns in every micro-partition.
◦Semi-structured and unstructured data. In addition to structured, relational data, our platform supports semi-structured data, including JSON, Avro, and Parquet, and unstructured data, including PDF documents, screenshots, recordings, and images. Data in these formats can be ingested and queried with performance comparable to a relational, structured representation. 

Table of Contents


•Query Capabilities. Our platform is engineered to query petabytes of data. It implements support for a large subset of the ANSI SQL standard for read operations and data modification operations. Our platform provides additional features, including:
◦Time travel. Our platform keeps track of all changes happening to a table, which enables customers to query previous versions based on their preferences. Customers can query as of a relative point in time or as of an absolute point in time. This has a broad array of use cases for customers, including error recovery, time-based analysis, and data quality checks.
◦Cloning. Our architecture enables us to offer zero-copy cloning, an operation by which entire tables, schemas, or databases can be duplicated—or cloned—without having to copy or duplicate the underlying data. Our platform leverages the separation between cloud services and storage to be able to track independent clones of objects sharing the same physical copy of the underlying data. This enables a variety of customer use cases such as making copies of production data for data scientists, creating custom snapshots in time, or testing data pipelines.
•Compute Model. Our platform offers a variety of capabilities to operate on data, from ingestion to transformation, as well as rich query and analysis. Our compute services are primarily presented to users in one of two models, either through explicit specification of compute clusters or through a number of serverless features.
◦Compute Clusters. Our platform exposes compute clusters as a core concept. Our customers can create as few or as many compute clusters as they want and specify compute capacity at tiered levels. These clusters can be configured to run only when needed, with cluster instantiation operations typically completed in seconds. Compute clusters can also be configured as a multi-cluster warehouse in which our platform can automatically add and remove additional instances of a given cluster to address variations in query demands. This gives us the ability to offer extremely high levels of concurrency with a simple configuration specification. We also offer warehouse recommendations for workloads that have large memory requirements, such as machine learning use cases.
◦Serverless features. We offer a number of additional services that automatically provide the capacity our customers require. For example, our data ingestion service automatically ingests data from cloud storage and allocates compute capacity based on the amount of data ingested; our clustering service continuously rearranges the physical layout of data to ensure conformity with clustering key specifications, improving performance; our materialized views service propagates changes from underlying tables to views that have materialized subsets or summaries; our replication service moves data between regions or clouds; our search optimization service analyzes changes in data, maintains information that speeds up lookup queries, and accelerates queries performing lookups of specific values; and our query acceleration service automatically offloads parts of eligible queries to shared, flexible compute clusters to handle high-burst workloads.
•Data Sharing. In our platform, data sharing is defined through access control and not through data movement. As such, the data consumer sees no latency relative to updates from the data provider, and incurs no cost to move or transform data to make it usable. Based on the same technology principles, our platform enables data clean rooms.

•Global Infrastructure

◦Database replication. Our platform enables customers to replicate data from one region or public cloud to another region or public cloud while maintaining transactional integrity.
◦Business continuity. Our platform enables failing over and failing back a database and redirecting clients transparently across regions or public clouds. This provides an integrated and global disaster recovery capability.
◦Global listings for sharing. Our platform enables a listing to be published globally to access consumers across regions or public clouds.

Table of Contents


•Built-in Security. We built our platform with security as a core tenet. Our platform provides a number of capabilities for customers to confidently use our platform while preserving the security requirements of their organizations, including:
◦Authentication. Our platform supports rich authentication capabilities, including federated authentication with a variety of identity providers, as well as support for multi-factor authentication.
◦Access control. Our platform provides a fine-grained security model based on role-based access control. It provides granular privileges on system objects and actions.
◦Data encryption. Our platform encrypts all data, both in motion and at rest, and simplifies operations by providing automatic re-keying of data. It also supports customer-managed keys, where an additional layer of encryption is provided by keys controlled by customers, giving them the ability to control access to the data.

Seasonality

Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher net cash provided by operating activities and non-GAAP free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. In addition, while historically revenue has been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, it is also the most negatively impacted by reduced holiday consumption. For more information, including a definition of non-GAAP free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including technical controls and contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes, and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.

Government Regulation

Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, AI Technology, environmental or related requirements or disclosures, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in future periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled “Special Note about Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or growth prospects. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations

We have experienced rapid revenue growth and have a limited operating history, both of which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.
Our revenue was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result of our historical rapid growth, limited operating history, and unstable macroeconomic conditions, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations, including revenue, remaining performance obligations (RPO), and the percentage of RPO we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods, is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth and platform consumption. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. 
Further, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including increased competition, changes to technology, such as changes in software or underlying cloud infrastructure or the increasing prominence of new technology like artificial intelligence, and reduced demand for our platform. For example, customers may continue to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management, including by reducing storage through shorter data retention policies and shortening committed contract durations. As a result of the foregoing and our rapid revenue growth in prior periods, our revenue growth rate has slowed in recent periods. Any further declines in our revenue growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. We have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described below. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.
We may not have visibility into our future financial position and results of operations.
Customers generally consume our platform by using compute, storage, and data transfer resources. Unlike a subscription-based business model, in which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, we generally recognize revenue on consumption. Because our customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition that a typical subscription-based software company has. There is a risk that customers will consume our platform at lower levels than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions or holidays. For example, during April 2023 and part of May 2023, consumption of our platform increased at a slower pace than expected. Unexpected fluctuations in customer consumption may cause actual results to differ from our forecasts. As a result, our results of operations in a given period should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.

We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
We have experienced net losses in each period since inception. We generated net losses of $838.0 million, $797.5 million and $679.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $4.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods. In particular, we intend to continue to invest significant resources to further develop our platform, expand our research and development teams, retain our employees, and acquire other businesses, including in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors. If we fail to meet any minimum commitments under these third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, we may be required to pay the difference, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We will also incur increased general and administrative expenses associated with our growth, including costs related to internal systems, operating as a public company, and targeting regulated industries or markets. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, or our revenue growth rate may be slower than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset the increase in operating expenses resulting from these investments. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, or if we are unable to achieve the revenue growth that we expect from these investments, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
Our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving increased use of our platform by existing customers. The markets in which we operate are rapidly evolving and highly competitive. As these markets continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our current competitors include:
•large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including AWS, Azure, and GCP;
•less-established public and private cloud companies with products that compete in some of our markets;
•other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and
•new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies.
We compete based on various factors, including price, performance, breadth of use cases, multi-cloud availability, brand recognition and reputation, customer support, and differentiated capabilities, including ease of implementation and data migration, ease of administration and use, scalability and reliability, data governance, security and compatibility with existing standards, programming languages, and third-party products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do, and may be able to respond more effectively than us to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements, and buying practices. In addition, we may not be able to respond to market opportunities as quickly as smaller companies.
We currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP, which are also some of our primary competitors. Currently, a substantial majority of our business is run on the AWS public cloud. There is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use its respective control of its public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products, provide us unfavorable pricing, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently with respect to terms and conditions or regulatory requirements than it would treat its similarly situated customers. Further, they have the resources to acquire, invest in, or partner with existing and emerging providers of competing technology and thereby accelerate adoption of those competing technologies. All of the foregoing could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide products and services that compete favorably with those of the public cloud providers.
For all of these reasons, competition may negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers and maintain and grow use of our platform, or it may put downward pressure on our prices and gross margins, any of which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.

If we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
We compete in markets that evolve rapidly. We believe that the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases of cloud data platforms on a broad range of factors, including performance and scale, markets addressed, types of data processed, ease of data ingress and egress, user experience and programming languages, use of artificial intelligence, and data governance and regulatory compliance. We introduced data warehousing on our platform in 2014 as our core use case, and our customers subsequently began using our platform for additional workloads, including data lake, data engineering, AI/ML, applications, collaboration, cybersecurity, and Unistore. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to innovate rapidly and effectively and increase customer adoption of our platform and the Data Cloud, including the Snowflake Marketplace and Snowpark.
Further, the value of our platform to customers is increased to the extent they are able to use it to process and access all types of data. We need to continue to invest in technologies, services, and partnerships that increase the types of data available and processed on our platform and the ease with which customers can ingest data into our platform. We must also continue to enhance our data sharing and marketplace capabilities so customers can share their data with internal business units, customers, and other third parties, acquire additional third-party data and data products to combine with their own data in order to gain additional business insights, and develop and monetize applications on our platform. As we develop, acquire, and introduce new services and technologies, including those that may incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical, and other challenges. In addition, our platform requires third-party public cloud infrastructure to operate. Currently, we use public cloud offerings provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP. We will need to continue to innovate to optimize our offerings for these and other public clouds that our customers require, particularly as we expand internationally. Further, the markets in which we compete are subject to evolving industry standards and regulations, resulting in increasing data governance and compliance requirements for us and our customers and partners. To the extent we expand further into the public sector and highly regulated countries and industries, our platform and operations may need to address additional requirements specific to those markets, including data sovereignty requirements. 
If we are unable to enhance our platform or operations to keep pace with these rapidly evolving customer requirements, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
If we are not successful in executing our investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, including generative AI Technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
We are investing significantly in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, or AI Technology. Our investments include internally developing AI Technology, acquiring companies with complementary AI Technology, and partnering with companies to bring AI Technology to our platform. Our competitors are pursuing similar opportunities. These competitors may, as a result of greater resources, branding, or otherwise, develop, adopt and implement AI Technology faster or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our successful development of AI Technology depends on our access to GPUs, which are currently in high demand. It is also possible that our investments in AI Technology do not result in the benefits we anticipate, or enable us to maintain our competitive advantage, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, we may not accurately anticipate market demand or offer AI Technology that amplifies our core data platform.

If we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.
Our platform processes, stores, and transmits our own sensitive data as well as customers’ and partners’ proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, such as personal information, protected health information, and financial data. Our platform is built on the infrastructure of third-party public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. We also use third-party service providers, sub-processors, and technology to help us deliver services to our customers and their end-users, as well as for our internal business operations. These third-party providers may process, store, or transmit data of our employees, partners, customers, and customers’ end-users or may otherwise be used to help operate our technology. Some of this third-party technology, including open-source software, could be used as an attack vector. Even though we may not control the security measures of these vendors, we may be responsible for any breach of such measures.
Threats to information systems and data come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” internal and external personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. We and the third parties on which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving cyber threats, including unauthorized intrusions, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, business email compromises, computer malware, social engineering attacks (including through deep fakes and phishing), internal and external personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software vulnerabilities, software or hardware disruptions or failures, and attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI Technology, all of which are prevalent in our industry and our customers’ and partners’ industries. Furthermore, future business expansions, acquisitions or partnerships could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. The techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our and our third-party providers’ platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or processed, or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. In addition, ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and severe, and we may be unwilling or unable to make ransom payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. In general, cybersecurity breaches or security vulnerabilities could lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, diversion of funds, unexpected service interruptions, increased insurance costs, and other harm to our business, reputation, and competitive position. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective.
We are a target of threat actors seeking unauthorized access to our or our customers’ or partners’ systems or data or to disrupt our operations or ability to provide our services. Threat actors may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities utilized by our third-party service providers. While we take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information security systems (such as our hardware and software, including that of third parties upon which we rely), we may be unable in the future to detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities on a timely basis. Any security breach of our platform, our operational systems, our software (including open-source software), our physical facilities, or the systems of our third-party service providers or sub-processors, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation and remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management’s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business. Security breaches and consequences from breaches, including negative publicity, may also prevent or cause customers to stop using our products, deter new customers from using our products, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.
We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. For example, SEC rules require disclosure on Form 8-K of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of such incident. Determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable may not be straightforward and any such mandatory disclosures are costly and could lead to negative publicity, loss of customer or partner confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management’s attention, governmental investigations, and the expenditure of significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach.

Table of Contents


A security incident may also cause us to breach, or lead to claims that we have breached, customer contracts or other legal obligations. As a result, we could be subject to legal action (including the imposition of fines or penalties) and our customers could end their relationships with us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations.
Litigation and regulatory actions resulting from security breaches or related to our information security practices may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our customers, our customers’ end-users, or other relevant stakeholders, or investigations, inquiries, or actions by regulators. We may be subject to, and have received in the past, requests by regulators for information about our security practices, experiences, and issues. Alleged failures, problems, or issues related to our information security, including following such information requests, could result in formal investigations or actions from a variety of regulators, including state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the SEC, and others. These proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management’s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate for data security, indemnification obligations, or other liabilities. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements) could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Risks related to our systems and security breaches are likely to increase as we continue to expand our platform and geographic footprint, grow our customer and partner base, and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of data. 
In addition, some of our employees work remotely, including while traveling for business, which increases our cybersecurity risk, creates data accessibility concerns, and makes us more susceptible to security breaches or business disruptions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
We could suffer disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies.
Our business depends on our platform being available without disruption. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform and with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which our platform relies. These problems can be caused by a variety of factors, including introductions of new functionality, vulnerabilities, and defects in proprietary and open-source software, human error or misconduct, natural disasters (such as tornadoes, earthquakes, or fires), capacity constraints, design limitations, denial of service attacks, or other security-related incidents.
Further, if our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers are terminated, suspended, or suffer a material change to which we are unable to adapt, such as the elimination of services or features on which we depend, we could be unable to provide our platform and could experience significant delays and incur additional expense in transitioning customers to a different public cloud provider.
Any disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies, or any material change in our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers, could result in reduced use of our platform, increased expenses, including service credit obligations, and harm to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price could decline.
Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:
•fluctuations in demand for our platform or changes in our pricing model;
•fluctuations in usage of our platform, including as a result of customer optimization efforts that result in reduced consumption to execute workloads;
•our ability to attract new customers;
•our ability to retain existing customers and drive their increased consumption of our platform;
•customer expansion rates;
•timing, amount, and cost of our investments to expand the capacity of our public cloud providers;
•seasonality, including the impact of holidays;
•investments in new features, functionality, and programming languages, including investments in AI Technology and in making our platform available to store and process highly regulated data or comply with new or existing data sovereignty requirements;
•fluctuations in consumption resulting from the introduction of new features, technologies, or capabilities to our software, systems, or to underlying cloud infrastructure, including features or capabilities that may increase or decrease the consumption required to execute existing or future workloads, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, or that allow customers to use our platform to provide compute services without requiring them to store data;
•our ability to execute on our business strategy, including our strategies related to the Data Cloud, such as Snowpark and the Snowflake Marketplace;
•the timing and frequency of purchases;
•the speed with which customers are able to migrate data onto our platform;
•fluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors;
•changes in customers’ budgets and cash flow management strategies and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;
•our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;
•the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly research and development expenses, including with respect to GPUs to develop AI Technology, and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;
•the amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, and other non-cash charges;
•the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees;
•the effects and timing of acquisitions and their integration;

Table of Contents


•general political, social, market, and economic conditions, uncertainty, or volatility, both domestically and internationally, as well as political, social, and economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers and partners participate or on which they rely;
•health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the impact, or timing of our adoption, of new accounting pronouncements;
•changes in regulatory or legal environments, including the interpretation or enforcement of regulatory or legal requirements, that may cause us to incur, among other things, expenses associated with compliance;
•the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in our business;
•the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period in which such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;
•rising inflation and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated or measured in foreign currencies;
•fluctuations or impairments in, or the full loss of, the market values of our strategic investments or of our portfolio, including changes to the value or accessibility of our cash and cash equivalents as a result of economic conditions or bank failures;
•fluctuations in interest rates;
•changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers; and
•significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform.
Any of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly or be adversely affected. If our results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class actions.
Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform.
We must increase the productivity of our sales and marketing organization to increase our sales to new and existing customers. It requires significant time and resources to effectively onboard new sales and marketing personnel and to train new and existing personnel so they are able to successfully sell our product. We also plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs that are industry-specific and focused on large organizations. Once a new customer begins using our platform, our sales team needs to focus on expanding consumption with that customer. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts generate increases in revenue that are smaller than anticipated. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.

Sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations.
Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller organizations, such as longer sales cycles, stronger customer leverage in negotiating pricing and other terms, more complex customer requirements, including our ability to partner with third parties that advise such customers or help them integrate their IT solutions, substantial upfront sales costs, less predictability in completing some of our sales, and higher customer support expectations. For example, large customers may require considerable time to evaluate and test our platform or new features prior to making a purchase decision. In addition, large customers may be switching from legacy on-premises solutions when purchasing our products, and may rely on third parties with whom we do not have relationships when making purchasing decisions. A number of factors also influence the length and variability of our sales cycle, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our platform, the renegotiation of existing agreements to cover additional workloads, changing laws, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles, and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes. As a result, the length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to deal closure, may vary significantly from customer to customer, with sales to large enterprises typically taking longer to complete. We have also historically seen consumption growth from large enterprises take longer than when compared to smaller enterprises. Moreover, large customers often begin to deploy our products on a limited basis but nevertheless demand implementation services and negotiate pricing discounts, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that sales to these customers will justify our substantial upfront investment. If we fail to effectively manage these risks associated with sales cycles and sales to large customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected.
Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in cloud spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.
Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. Negative conditions or volatility in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, bank failures, international trade relations, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations, or the existence of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare, or terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on cloud technologies, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, the ongoing Hamas-Israel and the Russia-Ukraine conflicts have created volatility in the global capital markets and could have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. In addition, unfavorable conditions in the general economy may negatively impact our customers’ budgets or cash flow, which could impact the contract terms, including payment terms, our customers demand from us. Competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices in an attempt to attract our customers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.
Our growth depends on the development, expansion, and success of our partner relationships.
As part of our vision for the Data Cloud, we will need to grow and maintain a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers. The relationships we have with these partners, and that our partners have with our customers, provide our customers with enhanced value from our platform and the Data Cloud, including the Snowflake Marketplace. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on the success of these relationships, and if we are unsuccessful in growing and maintaining these relationships or the types and quality of data and data applications supported by or available for consumption on our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Additionally, a small but increasing portion of our revenue is generated as a result of our relationships with global system integrators, managed service providers, and resellers. Increasingly, we and our customers rely on these partners to provide professional services, including customer implementations and migrations from legacy solutions, and there may not be enough qualified partners available, or we may not be able to develop or maintain relationships with enough partners, to meet customer demand. While we provide our partners with training and other enablement programs, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently, and our return on these investments may be lower than expected. In addition, new partners may require extensive training or significant time and resources to achieve productivity. If we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of these partners, or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their interactions with our customers, our ability to attract and retain new customers and expand customer consumption of our platform may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed.
If we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results will be harmed.
Our professional services business, which performs implementation services for our customers, has grown larger and more complex as our product revenue has increased. We believe our future success depends in part on investment in professional services to facilitate customer code conversion and migration from legacy solutions and adoption of our platform, especially with large enterprises. As a result, our sales efforts have and will continue to be focused on helping our customers more quickly realize the value of our platform and the Data Cloud rather than on the profitability of our professional services business. We price our professional services based on the anticipated cost of those services and, as a result, we expect to improve the gross profit percentage of our professional services business over time. If we are unable to manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results, including our profit margins, will be harmed.
If we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain the executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed.
Our success depends in part on the continued services of our executive officers, as well as our other key employees in the areas of research and development and sales and marketing.
From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or other key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. Our executive officers and other key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. For example, in February 2024, Frank Slootman retired as Chief Executive Officer and we appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy to replace him. The loss of one or more of our executive officers could harm morale, cause additional personnel to depart, or introduce operational delays or risks as successor executives learn our business, each of which could harm our operating results.
In addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based data platform products, including products with artificial intelligence capabilities and experienced sales, customer support, and professional services personnel. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the sophistication of our platform.

Table of Contents


In order to continue to hire and retain highly qualified personnel, we will need to continue to hire in new locations around the world and manage return to work and remote working policies, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. From time to time, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and can provide higher compensation and benefits. In addition, we require the majority of our employees to work from a physical office, while certain of our competitors allow remote work environments. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the actual or perceived value of our equity awards declines or continues to experience significant volatility, or if our existing employees receive significant proceeds from liquidating their previously vested equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. Furthermore, current and prospective employees may believe that their equity award offers have limited upside, and our competitors may be able to offer more appealing compensation packages. In order to retain our existing employees and manage potential attrition, including as a result of any stock price decreases and market volatility that impact the actual or perceived value of our equity awards, we may issue additional equity awards or provide our employees with increased cash compensation, which could negatively impact our results of operations and be dilutive to stockholders. Finally, if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached our or their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.
We also believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. As our workforce becomes larger and more distributed around the world, we may not be able to maintain important aspects of our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.
If the availability of our platform does not meet our service-level commitments to our customers, our current and future revenue may be negatively impacted.
We typically commit to our customers that our platform will maintain a minimum service-level of availability. If we are unable to meet these commitments, we may be obligated to provide customers with additional capacity at no cost, which could significantly affect our revenue. We rely on public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and any availability interruption in the public cloud could result in us not meeting our service-level commitments to our customers. In some cases, we may not have a contractual right with our public cloud providers that compensates us for any losses due to availability interruptions in the public cloud. Further, any failure to meet our service-level commitments could damage our reputation and adoption of our platform, and we could face loss of revenue from reduced future consumption of our platform. Any service-level failures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We assume liability for data breaches, intellectual property infringement, and other claims, which exposes us to substantial potential liability. 
In our customer contracts, we assume liability for security breaches and data protection claims caused by us and by certain third parties on which we rely. Our contracts with customers, investors, and other third parties may also include indemnification provisions under which we agree to defend and indemnify them against claims and losses arising from alleged infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property rights and for other matters. Although we attempt to limit our liability and indemnity obligations and negotiate corresponding liability and indemnification rights with vendors that would require them to contribute to our indemnity obligations, we may not be successful in doing so, and an event triggering our liability or indemnity obligations could give rise to multiple claims involving multiple customers or other third parties. There is no assurance that our applicable insurance coverage, if any, would cover, in whole or in part, any such liability or indemnity obligations. We may be liable for up to the full amount of the contractual claims, which could result in substantial liability or material disruption to our business or could negatively impact our relationships with customers or other third parties, reduce demand for our platform, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, and platform technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technology, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we acquired several companies, including Samooha, Inc., a privately-held company which developed data clean room technology; Neeva Inc., a privately-held internet search company which leveraged generative artificial intelligence; Mountain US Corporation (f/k/a Mobilize.net Corporation), a privately-held company which provided a suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the Data Cloud; and LeapYear Technologies, Inc., a privately-held company which provided a differential privacy platform. Any such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties or unexpected costs assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, or otherwise. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in the synergies or other benefits we expect to achieve, which could result in substantial impairment charges. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may inherit commitments, risks, and liabilities of companies that we acquire that we are unable to successfully mitigate and that may be amplified by our existing business. Finally, our acquisitions or investments may result in disputes or litigation, including in connection with the achievement of earnouts.
As part of our corporate development program, we invest in companies to support our key business initiatives. These companies range from early, growth stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams. Our strategic investments are subject to risk of inability to achieve the desired strategic synergies and partial or total loss of investment capital. Furthermore, our competitors may invest in these companies alongside us, and may obtain information about our corporate development program or other business plans. The financial success of our investment is typically dependent on an exit in favorable market conditions. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failure to achieve strategic business objectives as well as failure to achieve a favorable exit, we could recognize an impairment or loss on all or part of our investment. In addition, in certain cases we may be required to consolidate one or more of our strategic investee’s financial results into ours. Fluctuations in any such investee’s financial results, due to general market conditions, bank failures, or otherwise, could negatively affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the price of our common stock. If one or more of such investees fails to timely provide us with information necessary for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures, we may be unable to report our financial results in a timely manner, which would negatively affect our business and the price of our common stock.

Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our remaining performance obligations or in customer consumption.
Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher non-GAAP free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. Although we seek to moderate our cash outflows with our cash receipts, we may not be successful in doing so, particularly since we expect this seasonality to become more pronounced as we continue to target large enterprise customers based on their procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles. In addition, while consumption is typically lower during holidays, the magnitude of any decrease is difficult to predict and that may result in inaccurate financial guidance. For more information about non-GAAP free cash flow, including a definition of non-GAAP free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
We do business with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies, and heavily regulated organizations; as a result, we face risks related to the procurement process, budget, delays, and product decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements.
We provide our platform to the U.S. government, state and local governments, foreign governments, and heavily regulated organizations directly and through our partners. We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the government sector, including obtaining government certifications. However, government certification requirements may change, we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more required government certifications, or we may be required to make unexpected changes to our business or products to obtain or sustain such certifications. As a result, our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we satisfy the requirements of such certifications.
A substantial majority of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners. Doing business with government entities, whether directly or indirectly, presents a variety of risks. Many government entities need significant education regarding our business model, as well as the uses and benefits of our platform. The procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive and time-consuming, and government decisions about their procurement needs may, in certain circumstances, be subject to political influence. To pursue these opportunities, we incur significant up-front time and expense, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs, without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor or reseller) will win a contract. Beyond this, demand for our platform may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown. Further, if we or our partners are successful in receiving a competitive contract award, that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders in a legal action known as a “bid protest.” Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining or preserving contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. As a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of entering into customer agreements with government entities or with our distribution and reseller partners in the government market.

In addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory, or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or default. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for platform consumption prior to termination and settlement expenses. If a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities. Further, entities providing products or services to governments, whether directly or indirectly, are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. Such laws, regulations, and contractual provisions impose compliance obligations that are more burdensome than those typically encountered in commercial contracts, and they often give customers in the government market substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies may relate to intellectual property, price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, incident notification, and termination rights. In addition, governments may use procurement requirements as an alternative to lawmaking, and impose stricter requirements than would apply to the commercial sector in areas that are not directly related to the purchase. These rules and requirements may apply to us or third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. Such parties’ non-compliance could result in repercussions for us with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues.
In addition, federal, state, and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions. If, as a result of an audit or investigation, it is determined that we have failed to comply with applicable requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits or payments we have received, costs associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, and we may suffer reputational harm.
Further, we are increasingly investing in doing business with customers and partners in heavily regulated industries, such as the financial services and health care industries. Existing and prospective customers, such as those in these industries, may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with using and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding third-party vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward third-party vendors generally, or our company in particular, that we may not be able to, or may choose not to, meet. We may make special compliance commitments that are more expensive to satisfy than we anticipate, or that we are unable to satisfy. In addition, customers in these heavily regulated areas and their regulators often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products, and practices. In the event that one or more customers or their regulators determine that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements, we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business.
Our customers also include a number of non-U.S. governments, to which similar procurement, budgetary, contract, and audit risks of U.S. government contracting also apply, particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established. Such sales may also heighten our exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws. In addition, compliance with complex regulations, security certifications, and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant financial and management resources. In certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. Further, our business and results of operations will be harmed if our efforts to do business with governments and heavily regulated organizations do not generate the anticipated increases in revenue. Each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Any litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.
From time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims, including claims related to the loss of employee equity grants upon termination, intellectual property claims, or securities class actions or other claims related to volatility in the trading price of our common stock. For example, we are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our initial public offering (IPO). See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for more information. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements). A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, potentially harming our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
Natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners, and our customers operate. 
Our platform and the public cloud infrastructure on which our platform relies are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber attacks, military conflict or war, terrorist attacks, criminal acts, sabotage, other intentional acts of vandalism and misconduct, geopolitical events, and epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our U.S. corporate offices in which we operate and certain of the public cloud data centers on which our platform runs are located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Pacific Northwest, regions known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our facilities or the facilities of our public cloud providers could result in disruptions, outages, and other performance and quality problems.
Our customers are also subject to the risk of catastrophic events. If those events occur, demand for our platform may decrease. 
If we are unable to develop and maintain adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans if such an event occurs, our business could be seriously harmed. 
Our current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion, creating a variety of operational challenges.
A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. Customer accounts outside the United States generated 23% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. For example, we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with new partners in order to expand into certain countries, including China, and if we fail to identify, establish, and maintain such relationships, we may be unable to execute on our expansion plans. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources.
Our current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:
•slower than anticipated public cloud adoption by international businesses;
•changes in a specific country’s or region’s political, economic, or legal and regulatory environment, including the effects of pandemics, tariffs, trade wars, sanctions, or long-term environmental risks;
•the need to adapt and localize our platform for China and other countries, including as a result of data sovereignty requirements, and the engineering and related costs that we may incur when making those changes;

•unexpected changes in, or the selective application of, trade relations, regulations, or laws;
•new, evolving, and more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security, data localization, and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;
•new, evolving, and potentially more stringent regulations relating to AI Technology;
•differing and potentially more onerous labor regulations where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including regulations governing terminations in locations that do not permit at-will employment and deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations;

•currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue, RPO, and expenses, and the cost and risk of utilizing mitigating derivative transactions and entering into hedging transactions to the extent we do so in the future;
•limitations on, or charges or taxes associated with, our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;
•laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;
•limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining, protecting, or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks and patents;
•political instability, military conflict or war, or terrorist activities;
•exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), U.S. bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; 
•burdens of complying with laws and regulations related to taxation; and
•regulations, adverse tax burdens, and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult or costly to repatriate earnings and cash.
We expect to invest substantial time and resources to further expand our international operations, and, if we are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.
As we prepare to offer our platform to Chinese affiliates of certain multi-national customers, risks associated with economic, political, and social events in China could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
We are currently preparing to offer our platform to Chinese affiliates of certain multi-national customers. Under Chinese law, we must offer our platform through a Chinese-owned operating partner, which must assume control and management of certain aspects of our platform and serve as the seller of record. This requires a new operating and go-to-market model, and there is a risk that functionality or customer experience may suffer and that we may incur liability or brand impairment arising from the operating partner’s actions or inactions. In addition, developing and operationalizing this new model is a significant investment and may not generate expected returns.
We may also encounter the following risks: 

Table of Contents


•uncertainty regarding the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection for intellectual property rights in China and the practical difficulties of enforcing such rights;
•inability to secure our intellectual property and other proprietary information located in China from unauthorized access or theft;
•heightened risks of cyber incidents, which could lead to the unauthorized access to or exposure of customer data; 
•inability to comply with extensive and evolving Chinese laws that are often ambiguous or inconsistently enforced;
•changes in tax regulations that may impact the economics of our China operating model; 
•economic or political instability;

•a slowdown in China’s economy; and 

•a government-controlled foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the Chinese yuan to other currencies.
Further, geopolitical and national security tensions between China and the United States or other countries could lead to further restrictions on our ability to operate in China, increased scrutiny of our business operations in China, or unwillingness of certain customers to do business with us, including the U.S. federal government. 
Due to these and other risks, our operations in China may be more expensive or difficult than anticipated or they may fail, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.
We may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including our IPO, and payments received from our customers. We cannot be certain if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility and general economic instability. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to repurchase stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to invest and hold our cash.
Our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, and Brazilian reals, and will likely be denominated in other currencies in the future. Because we report our results of operations and revenue in U.S. dollars, we currently face exposure to foreign currency translation risk and may in the future face other foreign currency risks. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform to international customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as our international operations expand, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States. These operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Exposure to these risks and fluctuations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Table of Contents


If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage.
To be successful, we must protect our technology and brand in the United States and other jurisdictions through trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, service marks, invention assignments, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property rights and confidentiality procedures. Despite our efforts to implement these protections, they may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage for a variety of reasons, including:
•the failure by us to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights for important innovations or maintain appropriate confidentiality and other protective measures to establish and maintain our trade secrets;
•to the extent a customer or partner owns any intellectual property created through a professional services engagement, our inability to use or monetize that intellectual property as part of our business;
•uncertainty in, and evolution of, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights;
•potential invalidation of our intellectual property rights through administrative processes or litigation;
•our inability to detect infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by third parties; 
•uncertainty regarding the applicability of intellectual property protections to AI Technology (including outputs generated from AI Technology); and
•other practical, resource, or business limitations on our ability to enforce our rights.
Further, the laws of certain foreign countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets, such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. We may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could seriously harm our business.
Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents


We may become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.
We compete in markets where there are a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights, as well as disputes regarding infringement of these rights. In addition, many of the holders of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights have extensive intellectual property portfolios and greater resources than we do to enforce their rights. As compared to our large competitors, our patent portfolio is relatively undeveloped and may not provide a material deterrent to such assertions or provide us with a strong basis to counterclaim or negotiate settlements. Further, to the extent assertions are made against us by entities that hold patents but are not operating companies, our patent portfolio may not provide deterrence because such entities are not concerned with counterclaims. 
Any intellectual property litigation to which we become a party may require us to do one or more of the following:
•cease selling, licensing, or using products, features, or data sets that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate;
•require us to change the name of our products or services;
•make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages, including indemnification of third parties;
•obtain a license or enter into a royalty agreement, either of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, in order to obtain the right to sell or use the relevant intellectual property; or
•redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible.
Intellectual property litigation is typically complex, time consuming, and expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. It may also result in adverse publicity, which could harm our reputation and ability to attract or retain employees, customers, or partners. As we grow, we may experience a heightened risk of allegations of intellectual property infringement. An adverse result in any litigation claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If we use open-source software inconsistent with our policies and procedures or the license terms applicable to such software, we could be subject to legal expenses, damages, or costly remediation or disruption to our business. 
We use open-source software in our platform and in our professional service engagements. From time to time, companies that use third-party open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open-source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open-source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open-source licensing terms. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures in place designed to govern our use of open-source software, there is a risk that we may incorporate open-source software with onerous licensing terms, including the obligation to make our source code available for others to use or modify without compensation to us, or inadvertently use third-party open-source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. If we receive an allegation that we have violated an open-source license, we may incur significant legal expenses, be subject to damages, be required to redesign our product to remove the open-source software or publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, or be required to comply with onerous license restrictions, all of which could have a material impact on our business. Even in the absence of a claim, if we discover the use of open-source software inconsistent with our policies, we could expend significant time and resources to replace the open-source software or obtain a commercial license, if available. All of these risks are heightened by the fact that the ownership of open-source software can be uncertain, leading to litigation, and many of the licenses applicable to open-source software have not been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be construed to impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Any use of open-source software inconsistent with our policies or licensing terms could harm our business and financial position.

Risks Related to Our Tax, Legal, and Regulatory Environment

We are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data, including data privacy and security, and the failure or perceived failure to comply with these obligations could result in significant fines and liability or otherwise result in substantial harm to our business and prospects.
We are subject to data privacy and protection laws, regulations, guidance, external and internal policies and other documentation, industry standards, certifications, and contractual and other obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, use, and other processing of personal information. These obligations are rapidly evolving, extensive, complex, and include inconsistencies and uncertainties. Examples of recent and anticipated developments that have impacted or could impact our business include the following:

•The European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation established strict requirements applicable to the handling of personal information. 

•The EU has proposed the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, which, if adopted, would impose new obligations on using personal information in the context of electronic communications, particularly with respect to online tracking technologies and direct marketing.
•Certain other jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal information transfer laws, such as Brazil and China, which could make it more difficult for us to transfer personal information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal or other sensitive information that originates in the EU or China), or to enable our customers to transfer or replicate their data across jurisdictions using our platform. Existing mechanisms that may facilitate cross-border personal information transfers may change or be invalidated. An inability or material limitation on our ability to transfer personal data to the United States or other countries could materially impact our business operations and revenue.
•In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted or proposed data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. Additionally, in the past few years, numerous U.S. states—including California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah—have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. Such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making and, if exercised, may adversely impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), provides increased privacy rights and protections, including the ability of individuals to opt out of specific disclosures of their personal information, and provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Other U.S. states have adopted, or are considering adopting, similar laws.

•The certifications we may maintain and the standards that may apply to our business, such as the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), U.S. Department of Defense Impact Level 4 (IL4), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001, Health Information Trust Alliance Common Security Framework (HI-TRUST CSF), StateRAMP, among others, are becoming more stringent.

•We may also become subject to new laws that specifically regulate non-personal data. For example, we may become subject to certain parts of the European Union’s Data Act, which imposes certain data and cloud service interoperability and switching obligations to enable users to switch between cloud service providers without undue delay or cost, as well as certain requirements concerning cross-border international transfers of, and governmental access to, non-personal data outside the European Economic Area.

These and other similar legal and regulatory developments could contribute to legal and economic uncertainty, increase our exposure to liability, affect how we design, market, and sell our platform, and how we operate our business, how our customers and partners process and share data, how we process and use data, and how we transfer personal data from one jurisdiction to another, any of which could increase our costs, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and/or negatively impact the types of data available on or the demand for our platform. It is possible that new laws may be adopted or existing laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. We may incur substantial costs to comply with such laws and regulations, to meet the demands of our customers relating to their own compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to establish and maintain internal policies, self-certifications, and third-party certifications supporting our compliance programs. Our customers may delegate certain of their GDPR compliance or other privacy law obligations to us, and we may otherwise be required to expend resources to assist our customers with such compliance obligations. 
Although we endeavor to comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, any actual or perceived non-compliance with such obligations by us or our third-party service providers and sub-processors could result in proceedings, investigations, or claims against us by regulatory authorities, customers, or others, leading to reputational harm, higher liability and indemnity obligations, significant fines, litigation costs, additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal information, orders to destroy or not use personal information, limitations in our ability to develop or commercialize our platform, inability to process personal information or operate in certain jurisdictions, and other damages. For example, if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR or U.K. GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to (i) 20.0 million Euros or 17.5 million British pounds, as applicable, or (ii) 4% of our worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater, as well as potential data processing restrictions and penalties. In addition, private plaintiffs have become increasingly active in bringing privacy- and information security-related claims against companies, including class action claims. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for significant statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws and other obligations, investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity. In addition, any failure by us or our third-party service providers and sub-processors to comply with applicable obligations could result in proceedings against us. Certain regulators, such as the FTC, may prohibit our use of certain personal information as a result of such proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
We publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our security program and our collection, processing, use, and disclosure of personal information or other confidential information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we or our vendors may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Claims by regulators or private parties that we have not followed our published documentation or otherwise violated individuals’ privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
Issues in the development and use of AI Technology, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations.
The legal and regulatory landscape applicable to AI Technology is uncertain and is evolving rapidly, which may result in new and enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality, privacy or security risks, ethical concerns, legal liability, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results. For example, states, regions, and supranational bodies, including the European Union and the United States, have passed or proposed new rules and regulations related to the use or sale of AI Technology. These regulations may impose onerous obligations related to our development, offering, and use of AI Technology and expose us to an increased risk of regulatory enforcement and litigation. If we cannot use AI Technology or that use is restricted, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage.

In particular, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the applications of intellectual property and privacy laws to AI Technology. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI Technology have not been fully addressed by courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and our use of AI Technology or adoption of AI Technology into our products and services may result in disputes with respect to ownership or intellectual property, or exposure to claims of copyright or other intellectual property misappropriation. In addition, our AI Technology may involve the processing of personal and other sensitive data and may be subject to laws, policies, legal obligations, and contractual requirements related to privacy, data protection, and information security. Certain privacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to obtain consent or delete certain personal data) and regulate automated decision making. An alleged or actual failure to meet these obligations may lead to regulatory investigations and fines or penalties; may require us to change our business practices or retrain our algorithms; or may prevent or limit our use of AI Technology. For example, the FTC has required other companies to turn over or disgorge valuable insights or trainings generated through the use of AI Technology where they allege the company has violated privacy and consumer protection laws, meaning that we would be unable to use that data in our AI Technology. It is also possible that we are held liable for intellectual property, privacy, or other legal violations of third-party AI Technology that we use, and that we may not have full recourse for any damages that we suffer (for example, our use of third-party AI Technology may be subject to limitations of liability or provide no liability coverage (e.g., free or open-source technology)). 
The algorithms or training methodologies used in the AI Technology we use or offer may be flawed. Datasets may be overly broad, insufficient, or contain inappropriately biased information. Our generative AI Technology may also generate outputs that are inaccurate, misleading, harmful, or otherwise flawed. This may happen if the inputs that the model relied on were inaccurate, incomplete, or flawed (including if a bad actor “poisons” the model with bad inputs or logic), or if the logic of the algorithm is flawed (a so-called “hallucination”). Our customers or others may rely on or use such outputs to their detriment, or it may lead to adverse outcomes, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. Finally, if we enable or offer services or technologies that draw scrutiny or controversy, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. 
We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are subject to the FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international sales, including in China, and sales to the public sector, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market or resell our products and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.
While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, there is a risk that our employees, agents, and other third parties with which we do business, including reseller and system integrator partners, will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we expand internationally and into the public sector market, our risks under these laws may increase.
Detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.
Our platform is subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and we incorporate encryption technology into our platform. This encryption technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption classification request or self-classification report.
Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by various U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, that prohibit the sale or supply of most products and services to embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations can result in significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers.
If our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties.
Also, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our platform globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, increased export and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our international operations may subject us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
We are expanding our international operations to better support our growth into international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.

Table of Contents


Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws, regulations, or rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, 2017 legislation informally titled the Tax Act significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In August 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. In February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. We do not expect the excise tax on repurchases under our stock repurchase program to have a material impact on our aggregate tax liability. In addition, many countries have recently proposed, recommended, or enacted changes to existing tax laws or new tax laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.
Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. As of July 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (such as taxes based on a percentage of revenue or taxes applicable to digital services), which could apply to our business.
Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. We continue to monitor the impact of new global and U.S. legislation on our effective tax rate.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.
We have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. Unused U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused NOLs expire. Under the Tax Act, as modified by 2020 legislation referred to as the CARES Act, U.S. federal NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of such year’s taxable income. At the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.
As of January 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal, state, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $6.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $175.2 million, respectively. Of the $6.2 billion U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, $6.1 billion may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income, and the remaining $0.1 billion will begin to expire in 2032. The state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2024. Of the $175.2 million foreign NOL carryforwards, $169.6 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining $5.6 million will begin to expire in 2027.
In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increasing their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced or may experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent ownership changes and changes to the U.S. tax rules in respect of the utilization of NOLs may further affect the limitation in future years.

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined.
Our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:
•changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;
•changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them;
•changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;
•the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and
•the effects of acquisitions.
Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations.

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.
The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;
•variance in our actual or projected financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;
•changes in the pricing or consumption of our platform;
•updates to our projected operating and financial results;
•changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, investments, or new offerings;
•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•significant data breaches, disruptions to, or other incidents involving our platform;
•our involvement in litigation;
•changes in senior management or key personnel;
•fluctuations in company valuations, particularly valuations of high-growth or cloud companies, perceived to be comparable to us;
•the trading volume of our common stock;
•changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market;
•our issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock; and
•general political, social, economic, and market conditions.

Table of Contents


Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been, and may be in the future, the target of this type of litigation, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management’s attention. We are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our IPO. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for more information.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our stockholders who held our capital stock prior to completion of our IPO have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold based upon the price at which shares were sold in our IPO, and therefore, they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares. We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.
The shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plans, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will become eligible for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.
Further, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.
We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our stock repurchase program, and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.
In February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program expires in March 2025.
The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us, or our stock price.
The existence of our stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. Repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any stock repurchase program.

Table of Contents


If securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, the market price or trading volume of our common stock could decline.
The market price and trading volume of our common stock is heavily influenced by the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures. We do not have control over these analysts. If securities analysts or industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts downgrade our common stock or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. Further, investors and analysts may not understand how our consumption-based business model differs from a subscription-based business model. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, publish inaccurate research about our business, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the ability of the holders of our common stock to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
We incur significant costs operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs.
As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. We have established an internal audit group, and as we continue to grow, we will hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and update the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.

Table of Contents


During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
•authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;
•require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;
•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;
•establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
•establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;
•prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;
•provide that our directors may only be removed for cause;
•provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and
•require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our common stock would receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in an acquisition.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 
Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.
These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY


Risk Management and Strategy

We have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to (i) our information systems and data, which include critical computer networks, third-party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and software, and (ii) critical data, including our intellectual property, confidential information that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in nature, and our customers’ data. Our cybersecurity program includes an information security policy, access management policies, an open-source policy, security incident response processes, and a supply chain policy, in addition to the secure design and vendor management programs described below. For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us, see the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our information systems generally fall into two categories: our platform and our corporate systems. Each category has dedicated teams and processes in place to address cybersecurity risk. Our product security team, which reports into our EVP, Engineering, works alongside our product and engineering teams to address how security is designed into our platform. Our corporate security team, which reports to our Chief Information Security Officer within our Chief Financial Officer’s organization, is responsible for the secure design of our corporate systems. In addition, our Chief Information Security Officer manages a global security team that performs certain cybersecurity functions for both our platform and corporate systems, including certification management, incident response, threat detection, analytics, and offensive security (such as simulations and penetration tests). 

Table of Contents


We actively monitor our threat environment for cybersecurity threats using various methods, including automated detection tools, scans of the threat environment, investigations of potential threats we discover or that are reported to us, and reports and services that identify threats. We monitor our information systems for vulnerabilities using internal and third-party penetration testing, intelligence feeds, and vulnerability databases. We also have a bug bounty program. 
Our security teams work with management to prioritize our risk management processes and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including those that may materially impact our business. Our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats is a key risk area within our enterprise risk management program. Our Chief Information and Data Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and EVP, Engineering are responsible for management of cybersecurity risk under our enterprise risk management program, and senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors receive reports on the key risks and the effectiveness of our management of such enterprise risks. In addition, key cybersecurity risks are assessed as part of our internal audit program. We have completed various security audits and certifications, including SOC 2 Type II, SOC 1 Type II, PCI-DSS, HITRUST, FedRAMP High, and ISO/IEC 27001. We also employ a shared responsibility model where our customers are responsible for using and configuring our platform in a manner that meets applicable cybersecurity standards. As part of this shared security model, customers have sole responsibility for creating and securing their access credentials for our platform.
Each of our platform and corporate systems involves the use of third-party technology or service providers, or vendors, such as hosting platforms, open-source software, and application providers. We also use vendors to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to our platform and corporate systems, including consulting firms, external legal counsel, incident response vendors, penetration test providers, auditors, monitoring technology, and cybersecurity data providers. We have a vendor management program under which our corporate security, product security, and legal teams evaluate cybersecurity risks presented by our use of vendors. Depending on the nature of the technology or services provided, the sensitivity of the information systems and data at issue, and the identity of the vendor, our vendor management process may involve different levels of assessment designed to help identify cybersecurity risks. For higher-risk vendors, this process includes a vendor security questionnaire, an evaluation of the vendor’s security program and security documentation, and the imposition of contractual obligations related to cybersecurity on the vendor. All vendors are required to undergo this review, which is in addition to the applicable security reviews conducted by our product security and corporate security teams described above. 

Governance

Our board of directors has a cybersecurity committee of the board to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to the management of cybersecurity risks related to our products and services as well as our information technology and network systems. The responsibilities of the cybersecurity committee include overseeing our implementation and maintenance of cybersecurity measures, data governance, and compliance with applicable information security laws. The cybersecurity committee receives reports from management concerning our significant cybersecurity threats and risk and the processes we have implemented to address them and has access to various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity threats, risk, and mitigation. In addition, our audit committee has oversight responsibility over our internal financial controls and our enterprise risk management program, including disclosure controls related to cybersecurity. Finally, management periodically provides cybersecurity briefings to the entire board of directors. 
The members of management who are primarily responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats are Brad Jones, our Chief Information Security Officer, and Grzegorz Czajkowski, our EVP, Engineering & Support. Mr. Jones joined Snowflake in 2023 and previously served in various cybersecurity roles for over 12 years across multiple technology sectors, including manufacturing, software, and services. Mr. Jones reports to Sunny Bedi, who has served as our Chief Information and Data Officer since 2020 and, prior to joining us, served as VP of Corporate IT / Head of Global IT at NVIDIA, where his responsibilities included managing IT security. Mr. Czajkowski joined Snowflake as SVP, Engineering & Support in 2019 and, prior to joining us, served in various roles at Google, including as VP Engineering where he was responsible for a portfolio of Google Cloud data analytics and for internal services addressing data analytics needs of Google’s businesses. Each of Messrs. Jones and Czajkowski is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, integrating cybersecurity risk considerations into our overall risk management strategy, communicating key priorities to relevant personnel, approving budgets, helping prepare for cybersecurity incidents, approving cybersecurity processes, and reviewing security assessments and other security-related reports. 

Table of Contents


Our cybersecurity incident response processes are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to management depending on the circumstances, including the individuals named above, who work with our incident response team to help us mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents of which they are notified. In addition, our security incident response plan provides for reporting certain cybersecurity incidents to our board of directors.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We are a Delaware corporation with a globally distributed workforce. We recruit and hire employees in jurisdictions around the world based on a range of factors, including the available talent pool, the type of work being performed, the relative cost of labor, regulatory requirements and costs, and other considerations. The majority of our workforce began working remotely in April 2020 and although some of our employees continue to work remotely following the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our workforce has returned to physical offices. We currently lease offices in the United States, including in Atlanta, Georgia; Bellevue, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Bozeman, Montana; Denver, Colorado; Dublin, California; San Mateo, California; and Washington, D.C. We also have offices in multiple locations in Canada, Europe, and the APJ and EMEA regions. All of our offices are leased, and we do not own any real property. While we believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs, we intend to expand our facilities in the future as we continue to add employees around the world. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our future growth.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we have been and will continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners, and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. In addition, on February 29, 2024, a stockholder class action lawsuit was filed against us, our former Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California, alleging violations under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and other costs. The case is at a very preliminary stage. We and the other defendants intend to vigorously defend against the claims in this action. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. See Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Overview

We believe that a cloud computing platform that puts data and AI at its core will offer great benefits to organizations by allowing them to realize the value of the data that powers their businesses. By offering rich primitives for data and applications, we believe that we can create a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. 
Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful insights, apply AI to solve business problems, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. 
Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case’s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 40 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.

Table of Contents


We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. For compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer’s data stored in our platform. For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.
Our customers typically enter into capacity arrangements with a term of one to four years, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. When this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. When a customer’s consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period.
Our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving increased use of our platform for existing customers. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and primarily sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. Our sales force is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the industry, size, and region of prospective customers. Once our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 131% and 158% as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See the section titled “Key Business Metrics” for a definition of net revenue retention rate.
Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January 31, 2024, we had 9,437 total customers, increasing from 7,744 customers as of January 31, 2023. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Our platform has been adopted by many of the world’s largest organizations that view Snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. As of January 31, 2024, our customers included 691 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2023 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2024 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions

Our business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates. These conditions have caused, and may continue to cause, customers to rationalize budgets, prioritize cash flow management, including through shortened contract duration, and optimize consumption, including by reducing storage through shorter data retention policies. We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of general macroeconomic conditions across our business. For additional details, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”

Stock Repurchase Program


Table of Contents


In February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $591.7 million, including transaction costs, at a weighted-average price of $147.50 per share. All repurchases were made in open market transactions (including via pre-set trading plans). As of January 31, 2024, $1.4 billion remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase program. See Note 11, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.

Business Combinations

During the three months ended January 31, 2024, we acquired all outstanding stock of Samooha, Inc. (Samooha), a privately-held company which developed data clean room technology that enabled multiple parties to securely collaborate on sensitive data. The acquisition date fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was $219.0 million, which was primarily comprised of 0.9 million shares of our common stock valued at $174.2 million as of the acquisition date, $38.8 million fair value of our previously held equity interest in Samooha, and $6.0 million in cash and deferred cash consideration. In addition, we issued to certain of Samooha’s employees a total of 0.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for a portion of their Samooha stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over four years, subject to each of these employees’ continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $74.8 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of four years.
During the three months ended July 31, 2023, we acquired all outstanding stock of Neeva Inc. and its equity investee (collectively, Neeva), a privately-held company which developed search technology powered by artificial intelligence language models, for $185.4 million in cash.
During the three months ended April 30, 2023, we acquired (i) all outstanding stock of Mountain US Corporation (formerly known as Mobilize.Net Corporation) (Mountain), a privately-held company which provided a suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the Data Cloud, for $76.3 million in cash, and (ii) all outstanding stock of LeapYear Technologies, Inc. (LeapYear), a privately-held company which provided a differential privacy platform, for $62.0 million in cash. 
The results of operations of these business combinations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7, “Business Combinations,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding these business combinations.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance


Adoption of our Platform and Expansion of the Data Cloud

Our future success depends in large part on the market adoption of our platform, including new product functionality such as Snowpark. While we see growing demand for our platform, particularly from large enterprises, many of these organizations have invested substantial technical, financial, and personnel resources in their legacy database products or big data offerings, despite their inherent limitations. In addition, many customers are attempting to rationalize budgets, prioritize cash flow management, and optimize consumption amidst macroeconomic uncertainty. While this makes it difficult to predict customer adoption rates and future demand, we believe that the benefits of our platform put us in a strong position to capture the significant market opportunity ahead.
Our platform powers the Data Cloud, a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers that enables our customers to securely share, monetize, and acquire live data sets and data products. The Data Cloud includes access to the Snowflake Marketplace, through which customers can access or acquire third-party data sets, data applications, and other data products. Our future growth is increasingly dependent on our ability to increase consumption of our platform by building and expanding the Data Cloud.

Table of Contents



Expanding Within our Existing Customer Base

Our large base of customers represents a significant opportunity for further consumption of our platform. While we have seen an increase in the number of customers that have contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue growing these customers further, as well as continuing to expand the usage of our platform within our other existing customers. We plan to continue investing to encourage increased consumption and adoption of new use cases among our existing customers, particularly large enterprises.
Once deployed, our customers often expand their use of our platform more broadly within the enterprise and across their ecosystem of customers and partners as they migrate more data to the public cloud, identify new use cases, and realize the benefits of our platform and the Data Cloud. However, because we generally recognize product revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer. In any given period, there is a risk that customer consumption of our platform will be slower than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. 
New software releases or hardware improvements, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, may make our platform more efficient, enabling customers to consume fewer compute, storage, and data transfer resources to accomplish the same workloads. In addition, new product features allow customers to use our platform to provide compute services without requiring them to store data. To the extent these improvements do not result in an offsetting increase in new workloads, we may experience lower revenue. Our ability to increase usage of our platform by, and sell additional contracted capacity to, existing customers, and, in particular, large enterprise customers, will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing, macroeconomic conditions, overall changes in our customers’ spending levels, customers’ attempts to optimize their consumption, the effectiveness of our and our partners’ efforts to help our customers realize the benefits of our platform, and the extent to which customers migrate new workloads to our platform over time, including data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning workloads.

Acquiring New Customers

We believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base by continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and brand awareness. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including the productivity of our sales organization, competitive dynamics in our target markets, changes in our customers’ spending and platform consumption in response to market uncertainty, and our ability to build and maintain partner relationships, including with global system integrators, resellers, technology partners, and third-party providers of native applications on the Snowflake Marketplace. While our platform is built for organizations of all sizes, we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers, customers with vast amounts of data, and customers requiring industry-specific solutions. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel; if our sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time and maintain productivity; or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. 

Investing in Growth and Scaling our Business

We are focused on our long-term revenue potential and believe our market opportunity is large. We will continue to invest significantly in research and development to improve our platform, including in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, we are focused on expanding our business both domestically and internationally. As part of these efforts, we are investing in meeting the needs of organizations in geographies and specialized industries that have heightened data requirements, including with respect to data localization, privacy, and security. We intend to continue to invest heavily to grow our business to take advantage of our expansive market opportunity, while also focusing on profitability and cash flow.

(1)Free cash flow for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 included the effect of $31.3 million, $23.9 million, and $68.6 million, respectively, in the net cash paid on payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. See the section titled “Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
(2)Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were $380.8 million and $184.6 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. No equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. 
(3)Historical numbers for (i) net revenue retention rate, (ii) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, and (iii) Forbes Global 2000 customers reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. In addition, our Forbes Global 2000 customer count reflects adjustments for annual updates to the Forbes Global 2000 list by Forbes.
(4)As of January 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were approximately $5.2 billion, of which we expect approximately 50% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending January 31, 2025 based on historical customer consumption patterns. The weighted-average remaining life of our capacity contracts was 2.2 years as of January 31, 2024. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers' future consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. In addition, our historical customer consumption patterns are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Product Revenue

Product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms. Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources, which are consumed by customers on our platform as a single, integrated offering. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases, the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers’ historical usage to plan and determine financial forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue, which has been less than 10% of revenue for each of the periods presented.

Net Revenue Retention Rate

We believe the growth in use of our platform by our existing customers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We monitor our dollar-based net revenue retention rate to measure this growth. To calculate this metric, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the trailing two years from our current period end. Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. The cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a reseller arrangement. We then calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period. Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of capacity contracts within a customer’s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. We expect our net revenue retention rate to decrease over the long-term as customers that have consumed our platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and our product revenue that we use to calculate net revenue retention rate, and as their consumption growth primarily relates to existing use cases rather than new use cases. In addition, we have seen, and may continue to see, impacts on customer consumption patterns due to holidays and certain of our customers increasing their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than expected, which may negatively impact our net revenue retention rate in future periods.

Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million

Large customer relationships lead to scale and operating leverage in our business model. Compared with smaller customers, large customers present a greater opportunity for us to sell additional capacity because they have larger budgets, a wider range of potential use cases, and greater potential for migrating new workloads to our platform over time. As a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract large enterprises to our platform, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. For purposes of determining our customer count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. We do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.

Forbes Global 2000 Customers 

We believe that the number of Forbes Global 2000 customers is an important indicator of the growth of our business and future revenue trends as we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers and customers with vast amounts of data. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the 2023 Forbes Global 2000 list. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our core business operations.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in millions):

No equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of customers’ consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Moreover, RPO is influenced by a number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Due to these factors, it is important to review RPO in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere herein.

Components of Results of Operations


Revenue

We deliver our platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume our platform under either capacity arrangements, in which they commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of our revenue is derived, we typically bill our customers annually in advance of their consumption. However, in future periods, we expect to see an increase in capacity contracts providing for quarterly upfront billings and monthly in arrears billings as our customers increasingly want to align consumption and timing of payments. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to customers with lower usage levels or overage consumption beyond a customer’s contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer’s contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented approximately 3%, 2%, and 3% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
We recognize revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. We recognize the deployment fee ratably over the contract term. Such deployment revenue represented less than 1% of our revenue for all periods presented.
Our customer contracts for capacity typically have a term of one to four years. The weighted-average term of capacity contracts entered into during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 is approximately 2.6 years. To the extent our customers enter into such contracts and either consume our platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue to use our platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. In many cases, our customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, our on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or us.
We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. We do not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on our platform. For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer’s data stored in our platform. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.
Because customers have flexibility in their consumption, and we generally recognize revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer contract that typical subscription-based software companies may have. As our customer base grows, we expect our ability to forecast customer consumption in the aggregate to improve. However, in any given period, there is a risk that customers will consume our platform more slowly than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations.
Our revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists primarily of consulting, technical solution services, and training related to our platform. Our professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. Other revenue consists primarily of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes.

Allocation of Overhead Costs

Overhead costs that are not substantially dedicated for use by a specific functional group are allocated based on headcount. Such costs include costs associated with office facilities, depreciation of property and equipment, information technology (IT) and general recruiting related expenses and other expenses, such as software and subscription services.

Table of Contents



Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of professional services and other revenue. Cost of revenue also includes allocated overhead costs.
Cost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue consists primarily of (i) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with our customers’ use of our platform and the deployment and maintenance of our platform on public clouds, including different regional deployments, and (ii) personnel-related costs associated with customer support and maintaining service availability and security of our platform, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We periodically receive credits from third-party cloud providers that are recorded as a reduction to the third-party cloud infrastructure expenses. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our customer support team and our engineering team responsible for maintaining our platform.
Cost of professional services and other revenue. Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, amortization of an acquired intangible asset, and costs of contracted third-party partners and software tools.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and professional services organizations to support the growth of our business. Some of these investments, including certain support costs and costs of expanding our business internationally, are incurred in advance of generating revenue, and either the failure to generate anticipated revenue or fluctuations in the timing of revenue could affect our gross margin from period to period. 

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions. A portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the level of the customers’ consumption of our platform, and a portion of the commissions paid to the sales force is earned upon the origination of the customer contracts. Sales commissions tied to customers’ consumption are expensed in the same period as they are earned. Sales commissions and referral fees earned upon the origination of the new customer or customer expansion contracts are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that we determined to be five years. As our go-to-market motion evolves, more sales personnel will be compensated based on the level of the customers’ consumption of our platform. As a result, we will defer less sales commissions, and we expect that our expenses associated with sales commissions tied to customers’ consumption will increase during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. Sales and marketing expenses also include advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs, including our user conferences such as Data Cloud Summit and Data Cloud World Tour, offset by proceeds from such conferences and programs. In addition, sales and marketing expenses are comprised of travel-related expenses, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organizations, amortization of an acquired intangible asset, and outside services contracted for sales and marketing purposes. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense for the foreseeable future as we grow our business. However, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses.

Table of Contents



Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include contractor or professional services fees, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our platform. However, we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses. In addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software development costs are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, facilities, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, and other professional services fees, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative functions, insurance, unallocated lease costs associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, and other corporate expenses. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses.

Interest Income

Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to our available-for-sale marketable debt securities, net of associated fees.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net consists primarily of (i) net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on our strategic investments in equity securities, and (ii) the effect of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and U.S. federal and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the net income (loss) of our majority-owned subsidiary attributed to noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

The increase in stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to additional equity awards granted to new and existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) granted prior to our Initial Public Offering (IPO).
As of January 31, 2024, total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized was $3.0 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. See Note 11, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Product revenue increased $728.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased consumption of our platform by existing customers, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 131% as of January 31, 2024. The increase in product revenue was also driven by an increase in capacity consumption prices of approximately 3% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased consumption of higher-priced editions of our platform and better discipline over discounting.
We had 461 customers with product revenue of greater than $1 million for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2024, an increase from 331 customers as of January 31, 2023. Such customers represented approximately 65% and 63% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within these customers, we had 83 and 26 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2024. The substantial majority of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements, which represented approximately 97% and 96% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remainder was derived from new customers under capacity arrangements and on-demand arrangements. The preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. For purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers.
Professional services and other revenue increased $12.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform.

Cost of product revenue increased $153.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $78.2 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses as a result of increased customer consumption of our platform. Personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs also increased $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to new and existing employees. The remaining increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs.

Our product gross margin was 74% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to 72% for the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) higher volume-based discounts for our purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure, and (ii) increased cost efficiency as a result of cloud infrastructure processor improvements. While we expect our product gross margin to slightly improve for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, a number of factors could hinder any improvement in our product gross margin, including (i) fluctuations in the mix and timing of customers’ consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, (ii) whether or not a customer contracts with us through public cloud marketplaces, (iii) our discounting practices, including as a result of changes to the competitive environment, and (iv) the extent of our investments in our operations, including performance improvements that may make our platform or the underlying cloud infrastructure more efficient.
Cost of professional services and other revenue increased $27.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $26.0 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. The overall increase in cost of professional services and other revenue was also driven by increased amortization of an acquired developed technology intangible asset as a result of the Mountain business combination completed in February 2023, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with contracted third-party partners.
Professional services and other gross margin declined for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to overall increased costs from scaling our professional services organization, including increased headcount and amortization of an acquired developed technology intangible asset as a result of the Mountain business combination. However, we do not believe the year-over-year changes in professional services and other gross margins are meaningful given that our professional services and other revenue represents a small percentage of our revenue.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $285.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $206.2 million in personnel-related costs (excluding commission expenses) and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount, stock-based compensation, and overall costs to support the growth in our business. The increase in personnel-related costs included a $52.8 million increase in stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO that is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. See Note 11, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Expenses associated with sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions, increased $46.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increases in customers’ consumption of our platform. In addition, advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs increased $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to a $12.4 million increase in travel-related expenses.

Research and development expenses increased $499.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $423.3 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased stock-based compensation, headcount, and overall costs to support the growth in our business. The increase in personnel-related costs included a $237.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to new and existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO that is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. See Note 11, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform also increased $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year.
The remaining increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by (i) impairment charges of $7.1 million, recognized during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, related to our capitalized internal-use software development costs previously included in construction in progress that were no longer probable of being completed, and, to a lesser extent, (ii) increased costs associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization, and (iii) increased amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired from business combinations.

General and administrative expenses increased $27.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $20.0 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business. Costs associated with outside services also increased $5.6 million due to increased legal fees, accounting and other professional service fees related to the normal course of operations.

Interest income increased $126.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher yields on our investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities as a result of increased interest rates.

NM - Not meaningful.
Other income (expense), net increased $92.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) a decrease in impairments recorded on our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, (ii) a remeasurement gain recognized on a previously held equity interest as a result of a business combination completed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, and (iii) changes in net unrealized gains or losses on our strategic investments in marketable equity securities.

Our benefit from income taxes decreased $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a $7.7 million decrease in partial releases of valuation allowances as a result of the business combinations completed during the periods.
We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets, and the significant components of our recorded tax expense are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on the timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Our effective tax rate might fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than forecasted in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than forecasted in countries that have higher statutory rates

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of January 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $4.8 billion. Our investments primarily consist of U.S. government and agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and time deposits.
As of January 31, 2024, our RPO was $5.2 billion. Our RPO represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.

Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. Our IPO resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts of $121.7 million. We also received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million related to certain concurrent private placements, and did not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that were sold in these private placements. Our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, sales and marketing expenses, overhead costs, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and repurchases of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program.
As of January 31, 2024, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments related primarily to (i) third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, (ii) operating leases for office facilities, and (iii) subscription arrangements used to facilitate our operations at the enterprise level. These agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. For more information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2024, see Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our long-term purchase commitments may be satisfied earlier than the payment periods presented as we continue to grow and scale our business.
In February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $591.7 million, including transaction costs, at a weighted-average price of $147.50 per share. All repurchases were made in open market transactions (including via pre-set trading plans). As of January 31, 2024, $1.4 billion remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase program. See Note 11, “Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, as well as cash flows expected to be generated by our operations, will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and repurchases of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, for the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, our existing commitments to our third-party cloud providers, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, the continuing market adoption of our platform, and the volume and timing of our stock repurchases. We may continue to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may, as a result of those arrangements or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily consisting of (i) stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, (ii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iii) amortization of deferred commissions, (iv) net amortization (accretion) of premiums (discounts) on investments, (v) amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, (vi) net unrealized gains or losses on strategic investments in equity securities, and (vii) deferred income tax benefit or expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period.
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $848.1 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $838.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.3 billion, and net cash inflows of $390.7 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were (i) a $528.0 million increase in deferred revenue due to invoicing for prepaid capacity agreements outpacing revenue recognition, (ii) a $171.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increased headcount, growth in our business and the timing of accruals and payments, and (iii) a $59.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, partially offset by (a) a $212.1 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to growth in our business, (b) a $134.8 million increase in deferred commissions earned upon the origination of customer contracts, and (c) a $40.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to payments related to our operating lease obligations.
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $545.6 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $797.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.1 billion, and net cash inflows of $289.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations. 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $302.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of $751.1 million in cash collected from customers resulting from increased sales. This was partially offset by increased expenditures due to an increase in headcount and growth in our business. We expect to continue to generate positive net cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was $832.3 million, primarily driven by proceeds of $1.2 billion from net sales, maturities and redemptions of investments, partially offset by an aggregate of $275.7 million in cash paid for the Neeva, Mountain, LeapYear and other business combinations, net of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash acquired, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of property and equipment to support our office facilities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and purchases of intangible assets.
Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $597.9 million, primarily as a result of an aggregate of $362.6 million in cash paid for Streamlit, Applica and other business combinations, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, $185.4 million in net purchases of investments, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of property and equipment to support our office facilities and capitalized internal-use software development costs.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was $854.1 million, primarily as a result of $591.7 million in repurchases of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program and $380.8 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds of $118.4 million from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans.
Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $92.6 million, primarily as a result of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $184.6 million, partially offset by proceeds of $80.8 million from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans, and capital contributions of $13.0 million from noncontrolling interest holders.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.
The significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition and business combinations involve a substantial degree of judgment and complexity and therefore are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Many of our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. We consider our evaluation of SSP to be a critical accounting estimate. An observable SSP is established based on the price at which a service is sold separately. If an SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate it by maximizing the use of observable inputs, including the overall pricing strategy, market data, internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations, and other observable inputs. As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of our offerings, and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSP. Changes in SSP could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a given period.

Business Combinations

When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, our assessment of the information, and historical experience. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


Interest Rate Risk

As of January 31, 2024, we had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government and agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. In addition, we had $18.2 million of restricted cash primarily due to outstanding letters of credit established in connection with lease agreements for our facilities. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments are held for working capital, capital expenditure, and general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program as well as acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease or increase of $17.6 million in the market value of our cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments as of January 31, 2024.
As of January 31, 2023, we had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $26.0 million or an increase of $25.9 million, respectively, in the market value.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the U.S. dollar. The majority of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, although we also have sales in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British pounds, Australian dollars, and Brazilian reals. Therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk, but that will likely change in the future as we increase sales in these international currencies and enable sales in additional currencies. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Canada. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at period-end exchange rates. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
In order to manage our exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge primarily a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities positions and certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the volatility in cash flows associated with certain forecasted capital expenditures and a portion of our forecasted operating expenses denominated in certain currencies other than the U.S. dollar. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within twelve months. These forward contracts reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We did not enter into these forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a theoretical increase or decrease in operating loss of approximately $25 million and $32 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes that all foreign currencies move in the same direction at the same time in the absence of hedging activities. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes our platform more expensive for international customers, which may slow down consumption. We do not believe a 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would have had a material impact on our operating results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.

Other Market Risk

Our strategic investments consist primarily of (i) non-marketable equity securities recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative), and (ii) marketable equity securities. These strategic investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks, including volatility in the public and private markets, that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our investments, causing our financial results to fluctuate. Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment analyses, which involves an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.
The following table presents our strategic investments by type (in thousands):
|    |                                                                |                  |         |                  |        |    |         |

See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
We plan to continue these types of strategic investments as part of our corporate development program. We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations as a result of changes in market prices, changes resulting from observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer, and impairments to our strategic investments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Snowflake Inc.


Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Snowflake Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Capacity Arrangements

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company delivers its platform over the internet as a service. The Company’s customers consume the platform typically under capacity arrangements, in which customers commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices. Management recognizes revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources. The Company’s total revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $2.8 billion, of which a significant portion is recognized under capacity arrangements.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - capacity arrangements is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to revenue recognized under capacity arrangements. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over revenue transactions recognized under capacity arrangements. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating, on a test basis, revenue recognized under capacity arrangements by obtaining and inspecting invoices, customer order forms, cash receipts from customers, usage confirmations from customers, and usage records.

(1)On March 1, 2021, all shares of the Company’s then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion. See Note 11, “Equity,” for further details. 
(2)In connection with a business combination completed on December 20, 2023, the Company issued approximately 0.2 million shares of its Class A common stock to one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest in the acquired company that was held by the subsidiary prior to this business combination. These shares are treated as treasury stock for accounting purposes. See Note 7, “Business Combinations,” for further details.

2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2024 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company records noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in its majority-owned subsidiary. Profits and losses of the majority-owned subsidiary are attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.

Segment Information

The Company has a single operating and reportable segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, and allocating resources. For information regarding the Company’s revenue by geographic area, see Note 3, “Revenue, Accounts Receivable, Deferred Revenue, and Remaining Performance Obligations.”
The following table presents the Company’s long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):

|    |               |                  |         |                  |        |    |         |
|---:|:--------------|:-----------------|:--------|:-----------------|:-------|:---|:--------|

|  3 | United States | $                | 379,664 |                  |        | $  | 329,275 |
|  4 | Other(1)      | 119,928          |         |                  | 62,814 |    |         |
|  5 | Total         | $                | 499,592 |                  |        | $  | 392,089 |

________________

(1)No individual country outside of the United States accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s long-lived assets as of January 31, 2024 and 2023.


Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, stand-alone selling prices (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation, internal-use software development costs, the expected period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the carrying value of operating lease right-of-use assets, stock-based compensation, accounting for income taxes, and the fair value of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that management considers reasonable. These estimates are assessed on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, restricted cash and foreign currency forward contracts with high-quality financial institutions that have investment-grade ratings. For accounts receivable, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers up to the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company manages its accounts receivable credit risk through ongoing credit evaluation of its customers’ financial conditions. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. For information regarding the Company’s significant customers, see Note 3, “Revenue, Accounts Receivable, Deferred Revenue, and Remaining Performance Obligations.”

Foreign Currency

The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is primarily the U.S. dollar.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at period-end exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and have not been material for any of the periods presented.
For those subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity (deficit).

Revenue Recognition


The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) for all periods presented.

The Company delivers its platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume the platform under either capacity arrangements, in which customers commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which the Company charges for use of the platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of revenue is derived, the Company typically bills its customers annually in advance of their consumption. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to customers with lower usage levels or overage consumption beyond a customer’s contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer’s contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented approximately 3%, 2%, and 3% of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company recognizes revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. Deployment fees are recognized ratably over the contract term.
Customers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company’s platform. Pricing for the platform includes embedded support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the contract term.
Customer contracts for capacity typically have a term of one to four years. To the extent customers enter into such contracts and either consume the platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue to use the platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. In many cases, customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. Customer contracts are generally non-cancelable during the contract term, although customers can terminate for breach if the Company materially fails to perform. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, the Company’s on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or the Company.
For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer’s data stored in the platform. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed. 
The Company’s revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists primarily of consulting, technical solution services, and training related to the platform. Professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. Other revenue consists primarily of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. 
The Company determines revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606 through the following five steps:
1) Identify the contract with a customer. The Company considers the terms and conditions of the contracts and the Company’s customary business practices in identifying its contracts under ASC 606. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract has been approved by both parties, it can identify each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred and the payment terms for the services, it has determined the customer to have the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s payment history or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company treats consumption of its platform for compute, storage, and data transfer resources as one single performance obligation because they are consumed by customers as a single, integrated offering. The Company does not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on the Company’s platform. The Company treats its virtual private deployments for customers, professional services, technical solution services, and training each as a separate and distinct performance obligation. Some customers have negotiated an option to purchase additional capacity at a stated discount. These options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at the Company’s SSP, as described below, as the stated discounts are not incremental to the range of discounts typically given.
3) Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. Variable consideration is estimated based on expected value, primarily relying on the Company’s history. In certain situations, the Company may also use the most likely amount as the basis of its estimate. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).
4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The determination of a relative SSP for each distinct performance obligation requires judgment. The Company determines SSP for performance obligations based on an observable standalone selling price when it is available, as well as other factors, including the overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and customer-specific factors, including a review of internal discounting tables, the services being sold, the volume of capacity commitments, and other factors. The observable standalone selling price is established based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. If an SSP is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates it using available information including, but not limited to, market data and other observable inputs.
5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determined an output method to be the most appropriate measure of progress because it most faithfully represents when the value of the services is simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, and control is transferred. Virtual private deployment fees are recognized ratably over the term of the deployment as the deployment service represents a stand-ready performance obligation provided throughout the deployment term. 

Allocation of Overhead Costs

Overhead costs that are not substantially dedicated for use by a specific functional group are allocated based on headcount. Such costs include costs associated with office facilities, depreciation of property and equipment, information technology (IT) and general recruiting related expenses and other expenses, such as software and subscription services.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists primarily of (i) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with the customers’ use of the Snowflake platform and the deployment and maintenance of the platform on public clouds, including different regional deployments, and (ii) personnel-related costs associated with the Company’s customer support team, engineering team that is responsible for maintaining the Company's service availability and security of its platform, and professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs of contracted third-party partners for professional services, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company’s customer support team and engineering team responsible for maintaining the Company's service, and allocated overhead.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, unless they qualify as capitalized internal-use software development costs. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with the Company’s research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include contractor or professional services fees, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing the Company’s platform, amortization of acquired intangible assets, software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company’s research and development organization, and allocated overhead.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, excluding expenses associated with the Company’s user conferences, are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These costs were $85.3 million, $68.2 million, and $57.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred assets and liabilities are measured using the statutorily enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect when those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. 
A valuation allowance is established if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 
The Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position will be sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. This evaluation is based on all available evidence and assumes that the tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information concerning the tax position. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not (greater than 50% likely) to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company makes adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences may affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s equity awards include stock options, restricted stock unit awards (RSUs), restricted common stock granted to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers, and stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP Rights) to employees. Equity awards are reviewed in determining whether such awards are equity-classified or liability-classified.
Stock-based compensation related to equity-classified awards is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant and generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of each stock option granted and ESPP Rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the grant-date fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over an expected term, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for an expected term, and expected dividends. The fair value of each RSU is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For equity-classified awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, the stock-based compensation is recognized using an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, based on the Company’s periodic assessment of the probability that the performance condition will be achieved.
Certain RSUs with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions are liability-classified, as the monetary value of the obligation under each potential outcome of the performance condition is predominantly based on a fixed monetary amount known at inception and will be settled in a variable number of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of these awards is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires the use of various assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate. These awards are subsequently remeasured to the fair value at each reporting date until the number of these awards eligible to vest is fixed, at which time these awards will be reclassified to equity. Stock-based compensation associated with these awards is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition, using an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recognized for changes in the fair value estimated at each reporting date.
If an award contains a provision whereby vesting is accelerated upon a change in control, such a change in control is considered to be outside of the Company’s control and is not considered probable until it occurs. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period in which they occur.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, the Company began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than its previous approach of selling shares of the Company’s common stock. The amount of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee RSUs is reflected as (i) a reduction to additional paid-in-capital, and (ii) cash outflows for financing activities when the payments are made. The shares withheld by the Company as a result of the net share settlement of RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding, and do not impact the calculation of basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stockholders.

Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B Common Stockholders

As discussed in Note 11, “Equity,” on March 1, 2021, all shares of the Company’s then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers unvested common stock to be participating securities, as the holders of such stock have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is declared on common stock. 
Basic net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Snowflake Inc. common stock outstanding during the period, which excludes treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive Snowflake Inc. common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, restricted common stock, ESPP Rights, and early exercised stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock and the resulting basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders are, therefore, the same for both Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stock on both individual and combined basis.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash primarily consists of collateralized letters of credit established in connection with lease agreements for the Company’s facilities. Restricted cash is included in current assets for leases that expire within one year and is included in non-current assets for leases that expire more than one year from the balance sheet date.

Investments 

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale and are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term at each balance sheet date based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Short-term investments are investments with original maturities of less than one year when purchased. Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted using the effective interest method over the life of the related security and such amortization and accretion are included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.
For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria is met, the Company further assesses whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit-related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in the other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses and unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Strategic Investments

The Company’s strategic investments consist of non-marketable equity and debt securities in privately-held companies and marketable equity securities in publicly-traded companies, in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Strategic investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative) or impairment. For these investments, the Company recognizes remeasurement adjustments, including upward and downward adjustments, and impairments, if any, in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately-held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment. For example, determining whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires judgment based on the rights and obligations that are attached to the securities. In determining the estimated fair value of these investments, the Company uses the most recent data available to the Company. 
Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Non-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment analysis, which would involve an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company recognizes an impairment through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and establishes a new carrying value for the investment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, strategic investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable, derivative assets and liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for information regarding the fair value of the Company’s investments in marketable securities, strategic investments, and derivative assets and liabilities.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company’s derivative financial instruments, which are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, consist of foreign currency forward contracts as described below:
Non-Designated Hedges—The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks primarily associated with (i) a portion of its net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities positions and (ii) certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of twelve months or less and are not designated as hedging instruments (Non-Designated Hedges). As such, all changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations, and are intended to offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the underlying balances being hedged. Cash flows at settlement of such foreign currency forward contracts are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Cash Flow Hedge—During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility in cash flows associated with (i) certain forecasted capital expenditures and (ii) a portion of its forecasted operating expenses denominated in certain currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have a maturity of twelve months or less and are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and, in general, closely match the underlying hedged forecasted transactions in duration. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedges is assessed quantitatively using regression at inception and at each reporting date. The effective portion of these foreign currency forward contracts’ gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently reclassified into the same line items on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as the underlying hedged forecasted transactions in the same period that such transactions affect earnings. In the event the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified immediately from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Cash flows from such foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows from the underlying hedged forecasted transactions.
These derivative financial instruments did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable include billed and unbilled receivables, net of allowance for credit losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for credit losses is estimated based on the Company’s assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable by considering various factors, including the age of each outstanding invoice, the collection history of each customer, historical write-off experience, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the life of the receivable. The Company assesses collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on an aggregate basis when similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when specific customers with collectibility issues are identified. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.

Capitalized Internal-Use Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs, primarily related to its cloud platform. The costs consist of personnel costs (including related benefits and stock-based compensation) that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (2) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. Capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized costs are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three years, on a straight-line basis. Cost and accumulated amortization of fully amortized capitalized internal-use software development costs are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related software is no longer in use. The amortization of capitalized costs related to the Company’s platform applications is primarily included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, ranging from generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. Expenses that improve an asset or extend its remaining useful life are capitalized. Costs of maintenance or repairs that do not extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expenses as incurred. Cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization of fully depreciated property and equipment are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when they are no longer in use.

Deferred Commissions

The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if such costs are recoverable. Such costs consist primarily of (i) sales commissions tied to new customer or customer expansion contracts earned by the Company’s sales force and the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and (ii) certain referral fees earned by third parties. These costs are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that is determined to be five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its customer contracts, life of the technology, and other factors. Amounts expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred commissions, current, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred commissions, non-current, on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. A portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the level of the customers’ consumption of the Company’s platform, and a portion of the commissions paid to the sales force is earned upon the origination of the customer contracts. Sales commissions tied to customers’ consumption are not considered incremental costs and are expensed in the same period as they are earned. Deferred commissions are periodically analyzed for impairment. There were no impairment losses relating to the deferred commissions for all periods presented.

Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating various factors, including if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration and other facts and circumstances. Lease classification is determined at the lease commencement date. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not have any material finance leases for all periods presented.
Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist primarily of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and include certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor to the extent the charges are variable. The Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. In determining the appropriate IBR, the Company considers various factors, including, but not limited to, its credit rating, the lease term, and the currency in which the arrangement is denominated. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for its facility asset portfolio. In addition, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In addition, the Company subleases certain of its unoccupied facilities to third parties. Any impairment to the associated right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease is recognized in the period the sublease is executed and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. Sublease income is recorded as a reduction to the Company’s operating lease costs.

Business Combinations

The Company applies a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. When the Company acquires a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, the Company’s assessment of the information, and historical experience. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill for these business combinations.

Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets 

The Company’s long-lived assets with finite lives consist primarily of property and equipment, capitalized development software costs, operating lease right-of-use assets and acquired intangible assets. Long-lived assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds these estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. The Company did not recognize any impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.

Deferred Revenue

The Company records deferred revenue when the Company receives customer payments in advance of satisfying the performance obligations on the Company’s contracts. Capacity arrangements are generally billed and paid in advance of satisfaction of performance obligations, and the Company’s on-demand arrangements are billed in arrears generally on a monthly basis. Deferred revenue also includes amounts that have been invoiced but not yet collected, classified as accounts receivable, when the Company has an enforceable right to consideration for capacity arrangements. Deferred revenue relating to the Company’s capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of less than 12 months are classified as current. For capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of greater than 12 months, the Company apportions deferred revenue between current and non-current based upon an assumed ratable consumption of these capacity arrangements over the entire term of the arrangement, even though it does not recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract as customers have flexibility in their consumption and revenue is generally recognized on consumption. In addition, in many cases, the Company’s customer contracts also permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. As such, the current or non-current classification of deferred revenue may not reflect the actual timing of revenue recognition.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss, and an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition.

Recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Final Rules Not Yet Adopted

In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, which requires registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rules require information about a registrant's climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure of a registrant's greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related financial metrics in their audited financial statements. These requirements are effective for the Company in various fiscal years, starting with its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2025. Disclosures will be required prospectively, with information for prior periods required only to the extent it was previously disclosed in an SEC filing. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these final rules on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Disaggregation of Revenue

Revenue consists of the following (in thousands):

________________
(1)No individual country in these areas represented more than 10% of the Company’s revenue for all periods presented. 

(2)Includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.


Accounts Receivable, Net

As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, allowance for credit losses of $2.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, was included in the Company’s accounts receivable, net balance.

Significant Customers

For purposes of assessing the concentration of credit risk and significant customers, a group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other are regarded as a single customer. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company’s accounts receivable, net balance. Additionally, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company’s revenue for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Deferred Revenue

The Company recognized $1.4 billion, $974.3 million, and $535.8 million of revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from the deferred revenue balances as of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company’s RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements as there are no minimum purchase commitments associated with these arrangements, and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.
As of January 31, 2024, the Company’s RPO was $5.2 billion, of which the Company expects approximately 50% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending January 31, 2025 based on historical customer consumption patterns. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers’ future consumption, which is inherently variable at customers’ discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally on the purchase of additional capacity at renewal.

________________
(1)Includes a reclassification of $141.0 million from cash to cash equivalents for the money market funds balance as of January 31, 2023, as presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023. Such reclassification did not impact the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023 or its consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
The Company included $24.2 million and $19.4 million of interest receivable in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company did not recognize an allowance for credit losses against interest receivable as of January 31, 2024 and 2023 because such potential losses were not material.
As of January 31, 2024, the contractual maturities of the Company’s available-for-sale marketable debt securities did not exceed 36 months. The estimated fair values of available-for-sale marketable debt securities, classified as short-term or long-term investments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, by remaining contractual maturity, is as follows (in thousands):

For available-for-sale marketable debt securities with unrealized loss positions, the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will hold these securities until maturity or a recovery of the cost basis. The decline in fair values of these securities due to credit related factors was not material as of January 31, 2024 and 2023.

See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for information regarding the Company’s strategic investments.


5. Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2024 (in thousands):

(1)Includes a reclassification of $141.0 million from cash to cash equivalents for the money market funds balance as of January 31, 2023, as presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023. Such reclassification did not impact the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2023 or its consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
The Company determines the fair value of its security holdings based on pricing from the Company’s service providers and market prices from industry-standard independent data providers. Such market prices may be quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or pricing determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.

Strategic Investments

The tables above do not include the Company’s strategic investments, which consist primarily of non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative and marketable equity securities.
The Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market are used in estimating their fair value. The estimation of fair value for these assets requires the use of an observable transaction price or other unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company’s marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using the quoted market price.
The following table presents the Company’s strategic investments by type (in thousands):
|    |                                                                |                  |         |                  |        |    |         |

7. Business Combinations


Fiscal 2024

Samooha, Inc.
On December 20, 2023, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Samooha, Inc. (Samooha), a privately-held company which developed data clean room technology that enabled multiple parties to securely collaborate on sensitive data. The Company acquired Samooha for its talent and developed technology. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination.
Prior to this business combination, the Company, via one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Investing Subsidiary), held a noncontrolling equity interest in Samooha, which was accounted for using the Measurement Alternative with a carrying amount of $4.8 million (the Previously Held Equity Interest). In connection with this business combination, the Company remeasured the Previously Held Equity Interest at the date of the acquisition and recognized a gain of $34.0 million, which was recorded in other income (expense), net on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.
The acquisition date fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was $219.0 million, which was comprised of the following (in thousands):
|    |                                                  |                      |         |

________________
(1)Approximately 0.9 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, issued to selling stockholders that were not affiliated with the Company, were included in the purchase consideration, and the fair values of these shares were determined based on the closing market price of $194.28 per share on the acquisition date.
(2)In connection with this business combination, the Company issued approximately 0.2 million shares of its Class A common stock to the Investing Subsidiary in exchange for the Previously Held Equity Interest. The fair values of these shares were determined based on the closing market price of $194.28 per share on the acquisition date. These shares are treated as treasury stock for accounting purposes.
In connection with this business combination, the Company also issued to certain of Samooha’s employees a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in exchange for a portion of their Samooha stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over four years, subject to each of these employees’ continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $74.8 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of four years. In addition, the Company agreed to grant under its 2020 Equity Incentive Plan certain RSUs that contain both post-combination service-based and performance-based vesting conditions to eligible existing or future employees. See Note 11, “Equity,” for further discussion.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition:
|    |                                       |                                    |         |                                 |    |

________________
(1)Deferred tax liabilities, net primarily relates to the intangible asset acquired and the amount presented is net of deferred tax assets.
The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was estimated using the discounted cash flow method, which utilizes assumptions including projected future revenue generated from the acquired developed technology, projected profit margin, discount rate, and technology migration curve.
The excess of purchase consideration over the preliminary fair values of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination represents the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company’s offerings.

Neeva Inc.

During the three months ended July 31, 2023, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Neeva Inc. and its equity investee (collectively, Neeva), for $185.4 million in cash. The Company acquired Neeva primarily for its talent and developed technology. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination.
The purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment which did not have a material impact on goodwill. The updated preliminary allocation of purchase consideration, inclusive of measurement period adjustments, was as follows:

Other Business Combination

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of a privately-held company for $16.6 million in cash. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. In allocating the aggregate purchase consideration based on the estimated fair values, the Company recorded $1.6 million of cash acquired, $4.9 million as a developer community intangible asset (to be amortized over an estimated useful life of five years), and $10.1 million as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.
The excess of purchase consideration over the fair values of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expected synergies arising from the acquisition.
Acquisition-related costs, recorded as general and administrative expenses, associated with each of the business combinations above were not material during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.
From the respective dates of acquisition through January 31, 2024, revenue attributable to each of the companies acquired in fiscal 2024, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was not material. It was impracticable to determine the effect on the Company’s net loss attributable to each of the companies acquired in fiscal 2024 as these operations have been integrated into the Company’s ongoing operations since the respective dates of acquisition.

10. Commitments and Contingencies


Operating Leases

The Company leases its facilities for office space under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2035. Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised and therefore are not factored into the determination of lease payments.
In addition, the Company subleases certain of its unoccupied facilities to third parties with various expiration dates through fiscal 2030. Such subleases have all been classified as operating leases.

________________
(1)Includes $929.5 million of remaining non-cancelable contractual commitments as of January 31, 2024 related to one of the Company’s third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, under which the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at least $1.0 billion between June 2023 and May 2028 with no minimum purchase commitment during any year. The Company is required to pay the difference if it fails to meet the minimum purchase commitment by May 2028 and such payment can be applied to qualifying expenditures for cloud infrastructure services for up to twelve months after May 2028.
(2)Also includes $247.2 million of remaining non-cancelable contractual commitments as of January 31, 2024 related to another one of the Company’s third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, under which the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at least $250.0 million between January 2024 and December 2028 with no minimum purchase commitment during any year. The Company is required to pay the difference if it fails to meet the minimum purchase commitment by December 2028.
401(k) Plan—The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all eligible U.S. employees. Contributions to the 401(k) plan are discretionary. The Company did not make any matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Legal Matters—On March 23, 2021, a former employee filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) claiming that he was terminated in retaliation for engaging in concerted activity protected under the National Labor Relations Act. On September 15, 2023, following a hearing before a NLRB administrative law judge, the administrative law judge issued his ruling in favor of the former employee and ordered that he be awarded certain compensatory and other damages.
The Company is appealing the ruling to the Board of the NLRB. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that a loss could ultimately result from an unfavorable outcome and that an estimate of the potential range of loss is between zero and $25 million, plus interest. No material loss accrual was recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2024, because management believes the likelihood of material loss resulting from this charge is not probable given the further appellate proceedings that are due to take place.
In addition, the Company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes that none of its current legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Letters of Credit—As of January 31, 2024, the Company had a total of $18.2 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding, substantially in favor of certain landlords for the Company’s leased facilities. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.
Indemnification—The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, investors, contractors, customers, and the Company’s officers, non-employee directors, and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party for claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party from actual or threatened third-party claims due to the Company’s activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. For each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions were not material.

11. Equity

Preferred Stock—In connection with the Initial Public Offering (IPO) in September 2020, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which authorized the issuance of 200.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors.
Common Stock and Elimination of Dual-Class Structure—The Company has two classes of common stock authorized: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In connection with the IPO in September 2020, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of 2.5 billion shares of Class A common stock and 355.0 million shares of Class B common stock. On March 1, 2021, all 169.5 million shares of the Company's then-outstanding Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion. 
The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock were identical prior to the conversion, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. Prior to the conversion, each share of Class B common stock was entitled to cast ten votes per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. As a result of the conversion, all former holders of shares of Class B common stock are now holders of shares of Class A common stock, which is entitled to only one vote per share on all matters subject to a stockholder vote. Class A and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive any dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors.
Prior to the conversion, shares of Class B common stock were convertible to Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, and shares of Class B common stock would automatically convert to Class A common stock upon the following: (i) sale or transfer of such share of Class B common stock; (ii) the death of the Class B common stockholder (or nine months after the date of death if the stockholder is one of the Company’s founders); and (iii) on the final conversion date, defined as the earlier to occur following an IPO of (a) the first trading day on or after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represented less than 10% of the then outstanding Class A and Class B common stock; (b) September 15, 2027, which is the seventh anniversary of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with the IPO; or (c) the date specified by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class.
In addition, on March 3, 2021, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement of the shares of Class B common stock that were issued but no longer outstanding following the conversion. Upon the effectiveness of the certificate, the Company’s total number of authorized shares of capital stock was reduced by the retirement of 169.5 million shares of Class B common stock.
The Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows (in thousands):

Stock Repurchase Program—In February 2023, the Company’s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of its outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using the Company’s working capital and will expire in March 2025. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion.
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity under the Company’s stock repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):

________________
(1)Includes transaction costs associated with the repurchases.
As of January 31, 2024, $1.4 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. The first 0.5 million shares repurchased during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 were recorded in treasury stock as a reduction to the stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets. All subsequent repurchases of common stock were retired. Upon retirement, the par value of the common stock repurchased was deducted from common stock and any excess of repurchase price (including associated transaction costs) over par value was recorded entirely to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) on the consolidated balance sheets.
Treasury Stock—As described above, 0.5 million shares were repurchased under the Company’s authorized stock repurchase program and recorded in treasury stock, of which 8,000 shares were reissued upon settlement of equity awards during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.
In addition, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, in connection with the Samooha business combination as discussed in Note 7, “Business Combinations,” the Company issued approximately 0.2 million shares of its Class A common stock to one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest in Samooha that was held by the subsidiary prior to this business combination. These shares are treated as treasury stock for accounting purposes.
Equity Incentive Plans—The Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (2020 Plan), which became effective in connection with its IPO in September 2020, provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSUs, performance awards and other forms of equity compensation (collectively, equity awards). All shares that remain available for future grants are under the 2020 Plan.
The Company’s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) provided for the grant of equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers of the Company. The 2012 Plan was terminated in September 2020 in connection with the IPO but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the termination of the 2012 Plan. Upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of common stock underlying outstanding equity awards granted under the 2012 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2020 Plan. No further equity awards will be granted under the 2012 Plan. On March 1, 2021, all shares of the Company’s then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock. As a result of this conversion, options and RSUs that were previously denominated in shares of Class B common stock and issued under the 2012 Plan remained unchanged, except that they represent the right to receive shares of Class A common stock.
A total of 34.1 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan in addition to (i) any annual automatic evergreen increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan and (ii) upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of Class B common stock underlying outstanding stock awards granted under the 2012 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, such number of shares not to exceed 78.8 million. On February 1, 2023, the shares available for future grants under the 2020 Plan were automatically increased by 16.2 million shares pursuant to the provision described in the preceding sentence.
The Company’s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2020 ESPP), which became effective in connection with the IPO, authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. A total of 5.7 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock was initially reserved for future issuance under the 2020 ESPP, in addition to any annual automatic evergreen increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2020 ESPP. On February 1, 2023, the shares available for future grants under the 2020 ESPP were automatically increased by 3.2 million shares pursuant to the provision described in the preceding sentence. The price at which Class A common stock is purchased under the 2020 ESPP is equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Offering periods are generally six months long and begin on March 15 and September 15 of each year, except for the first two offering periods. The initial offering period began on September 15, 2020 and ended on February 26, 2021. The second offering period began on March 1, 2021 and ended on September 14, 2021.
Stock Options—Stock options granted under the 2012 Plan and the 2020 Plan (collectively, the Plans) generally vest based on continued service over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Certain stock options granted under the 2012 Plan are exercisable at any time following the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.
A summary of stock option activity and activity regarding shares available for grant under the Plans during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $101.66. No options were granted during each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2022. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion, and $5.7 billion, respectively. The aggregate grant-date fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $42.3 million, $79.1 million, and $81.0 million, respectively.
Early Exercised Stock Options—Common stock purchased pursuant to an early exercise of stock options is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until those shares vest. The consideration received for an exercise of an option is considered to be a deposit of the exercise price and the related dollar amount is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The shares issued upon the early exercise of these unvested stock option awards, which are reflected as exercises in the stock option activity table above, are considered to be legally issued and outstanding on the date of exercise. Upon termination of service, the Company may repurchase unvested shares acquired through the early exercise of stock options at a price equal to the price per share paid upon the exercise of such options. No unvested shares were subject to repurchase as a result of early exercised options as of January 31, 2024, and unvested shares subject to repurchase as a result of early exercised options were not material as of January 31, 2023.
Equity-Classified RSUs—RSUs granted under the 2012 Plan are equity-classified and had both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, of which the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the IPO in September 2020. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is typically satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. Stock-based compensation associated with RSUs granted under the 2012 Plan was recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time it was deemed probable that the vesting condition was met through the time the service-based vesting condition had been achieved. 
Equity-classified RSUs granted under the 2020 Plan include those that only contain a service-based vesting condition that is typically satisfied over four years, and the related stock-based compensation for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In addition, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Company granted, under the 2020 Plan, equity-classified RSUs that have both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (Leadership PRSUs) to its executive officers and certain other members of its senior leadership team. The service-based vesting condition for these Leadership PRSUs is satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon the achievement of certain Company annual performance targets set by the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company. The ultimate number of the Leadership PRSUs eligible to vest ranges between 0% to 120% of the target number of the Leadership PRSUs based on the weighted-average achievement of such Company annual performance metrics for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Stock-based compensation associated with these Leadership PRSUs is recognized using an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, based on the Company’s periodic assessment of the probability that the performance condition will be achieved. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Company recognized stock-based compensation of $30.8 million associated with these PRSUs. 
A summary of equity-classified RSUs activity during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:

Liability-Classified RSUs—During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, in connection with the Samooha business combination as discussed in Note 7, “Business Combinations,” the Company agreed to grant, under the 2020 Plan, RSUs that contain both post-combination service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (Acquisition PRSUs) to eligible existing or future employees, subject to a maximum total number of approximately 1.7 million shares. The post-combination service-based vesting condition for these Acquisition PRSUs is satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The performance-based vesting condition is contingent on the achievement of certain performance metric over the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2027. Acquisition PRSUs will vest when both service-based and performance-based conditions are satisfied. The ultimate number of Acquisition PRSUs eligible to vest is determined based on the actual achievement of the performance metric, which takes into account certain factors including the price of the Company’s stock price and market capitalization. 
Once granted, Acquisition PRSUs are initially liability-classified and recorded in other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, as the monetary value of the obligation under each potential outcome of the performance condition is predominantly based on a fixed monetary amount known at inception and will be settled in a variable number of shares. Subsequently, these awards are remeasured to the fair value at each reporting date until the number of Acquisition PRSUs eligible to vest is fixed, at which time these awards will be reclassified to equity. Stock-based compensation associated with these awards is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition, using an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recognized for changes in the fair value estimated at each reporting date. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Company recognized stock-based compensation of $0.5 million associated with Acquisition PRSUs.
A summary of liability-classified RSUs activity during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 is as follows:

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, in connection with the Samooha business combination, the Company issued to certain of Samooha’s employees a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in exchange for a portion of their Samooha stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over four years, subject to each of these employees’ continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $74.8 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of four years. As of January 31, 2024, all 0.4 million shares remained unvested.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, in connection with the Streamlit business combination, the Company issued to Streamlit’s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock outside of the Plans in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder’s continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $93.7 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, 0.3 million and 0.4 million shares remained unvested.

Expected term—For stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, the Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method, which is essentially the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual term, as the Company’s historical option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The expected term for ESPP Rights approximates the offering period.
Expected volatility—The Company uses the average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of representative public companies to develop an expected volatility assumption.
Risk-free interest rate—Risk-free rate is estimated based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury debt securities for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant.
Expected dividend yield—Because the Company has never paid and has no intention to pay cash dividends on common stock, the expected dividend yield is zero.
Fair value of underlying common stock—Since the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Expected volatility—Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Class A common stock.

The valuation allowance was $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily relating to U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development, and tax credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased $520.4 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to increased capitalized research and development, U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and deferred revenue. The valuation allowance increased $241.9 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to increased capitalized research and development, tax credit carryforwards, U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and stock-based compensation.
As of January 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $6.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $175.2 million, respectively. Of the $6.2 billion U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, $6.1 billion may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income, and the remaining $0.1 billion will begin to expire in 2032. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2024. Of the $175.2 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards, $169.6 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining $5.6 million will begin to expire in 2027. As of January 31, 2024, the Company also had federal and state tax credits of $356.9 million and $158.0 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in 2032 if not utilized. The state tax credit carryforwards do not expire. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for the cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2024 due to the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
The following table shows the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
|    |                                                            |                               |         |      |        |      |        |        |    |        |

There were no interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next 12 months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and in various international jurisdictions. Tax years 2012 and forward generally remain open for examination for federal and state tax purposes. Tax years 2017 and forward generally remain open for examination for foreign tax purposes. To the extent utilized in future years’ tax returns, net operating loss carryforwards at January 31, 2024 and 2023 will remain subject to examination until the respective tax year is closed.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Act) into law. The Inflation Act contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on stock repurchases. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Inflation Act had no material impact to the Company, including its stock repurchase program. The Company is continuing to evaluate the various provisions of the Inflation Act and does not anticipate the impact, if any, will be material to the Company.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
