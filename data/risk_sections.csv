HUBS,item 1a. risk factors
HUBS,"an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report on form 10-k and in our other public filings before making an investment decision. our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. if any such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment."
HUBS,"risks related to our business and strategy  we are dependent upon customer renewals, the addition of new customers, increased revenue from existing customers and the continued growth of the market for a customer platform."
HUBS,"we derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our customer platform. the market for inbound marketing, sales, service, operations, commerce and customer management products is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of point applications and different approaches to enable businesses to address their respective needs. as a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our platform and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. in addition, our growth strategy involves a scalable pricing model (including freemium versions of our products) intended to provide us with an opportunity to increase the value of our customer relationships over time as we expand their use of our platform, sell to other parts of their organizations, cross-sell our sales products to existing marketing product customers and vice versa through touchless or low touch in product purchases, and upsell additional offerings and features. if our cross-selling efforts are unsuccessful or if our existing customers do not expand their use of our platform or adopt additional offerings and features, our operating results may suffer.  our subscription renewal rates may decrease, and any decrease could harm our future revenue and operating results.  our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription periods, substantially all of which are one year or less. in addition, our customers may seek to renew for lower subscription tiers, for fewer contacts or seats, or for shorter contract lengths. also, customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions for a variety of reasons. our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including limited customer resources, pricing changes, the prices of services offered by our competitors, adoption and utilization of our platform and add-on applications by our customers, adoption of our new products, customer satisfaction with our platform, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.  in addition, a subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows. a portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. in addition, we do not record deferred revenue beyond amounts invoiced as a liability on our balance sheet. a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. if we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. we face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing, sales, customer service, operations, commerce, and content management software and other related applications, as well as internally developed software, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business.  the marketing, sales, customer service, operations, commerce, and content management software market is evolving, highly competitive and significantly fragmented. with the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices.  we face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and content management software and from marketing services companies that provide interactive marketing services. competition could significantly impede our ability to sell subscriptions to our customer platform on terms favorable to us. our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies including as a result of new or better use of evolving artificial intelligence (“ai”) technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive, or obsolete. in addition, if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our platform, we may need to decrease the prices or accept less favorable terms for our platform subscriptions in order to remain competitive. if we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected.  our competitors include:   cloud-based marketing automation providers;   email marketing software vendors;   sales force automation and crm software vendors;   large-scale enterprise suites;   customer service software providers; and   content management systems.  in addition, instead of using our platform, some prospective customers may elect to combine disparate point applications, such as content management, marketing automation, crm, analytics and social media management. we expect that new competitors, such as enterprise software vendors that have traditionally focused on enterprise resource planning or other applications supporting back office functions, will develop and introduce applications serving customer-facing and other front office functions. this development could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. in addition, sales force automation and crm vendors could acquire or develop applications that compete with our sales and crm offerings. some of these companies have acquired social media marketing and other marketing software providers to integrate with their broader offerings.  our current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. as a result, these competitors may respond faster to new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their products. in a few cases, these vendors may also be able to offer marketing, sales, customer service and content management software at little or no additional cost by bundling it with their existing suite of applications. to the extent any of our competitors has existing relationships with potential customers for either marketing software or other applications, those customers may be unwilling to purchase our platform because of their existing relationships with our competitor. if we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our customer platform could substantially decline. in addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be adversely affected. our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distribution and technology partners or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote and implement our platform. we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  we have experienced rapid growth and organizational change in recent periods and expect growth of headcount and operations over the long-term. if we fail to manage growth and organizational change effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.  after the implementation of our restructuring plan in january 2023, our headcount and operations continued to grow. for example, we had 7,663 full-time employees as of december 31, 2023 and 7,433 as of december 31, 2022. to date, we have opened several international offices. this growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we expect to continue to grow headcount and operations over the long-term. we anticipate future growth will be required over the long term to address increases in our product offerings and continued expansion. our success will depend in part upon our ability to recruit, hire, train, manage and integrate qualified managers, technical personnel and employees in specialized roles within our company, including in technology, sales and marketing. furthermore, as more of our employees work remotely from geographic areas across the globe on a permanent basis pursuant to our hybrid workplace model, which provides our employees with the option to be fully remote, work full-time from one of our offices, or have the flexibility to  work both in the office and remotely, we may need to reallocate our investment of resources and closely monitor a variety of local regulations and requirements, including local tax laws. we may experience unpredictability in our expenses and employee work culture. if we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, if our new employees perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, hiring, training, managing and integrating new employees, or retaining our existing employees, it could materially impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing, sales, customer service, operations, commerce and content management capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.  to increase customers and achieve broader market acceptance of our customer platform, we will need to continue to expand our marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and content management capabilities, including our sales force and third-party channel partners. we will continue to dedicate significant resources to inbound sales and marketing programs. the effectiveness of our inbound sales and marketing and third-party channel partners has varied over time and may vary in the future and depends on our ability to maintain and improve our customer platform including with respect to ai and machine learning. all of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.  the rate of growth of our business depends on the continued participation and level of service of our solutions partners.  we rely on our solutions partners to provide certain services to our customers, as well as pursue sales of our customer platform to customers. to the extent we do not attract new solutions partners, or existing or new solutions partners do not refer a growing number of customers to us, our revenue and operating results would be harmed. in addition, if our solutions partners do not continue to provide services to our customers, we would be required to provide such services ourselves either by expanding our internal team or engaging other third-party providers, which would increase our operating costs.  if we fail to maintain our inbound thought leadership position, our business may suffer.  we believe that maintaining our thought leadership position in inbound marketing, sales, services, operations, commerce and content management is an important element in attracting new customers. we devote significant resources to develop and maintain our thought leadership position, with a focus on identifying and interpreting emerging trends in the inbound experience, shaping and guiding industry dialog and creating and sharing the best inbound practices. our activities related to developing and maintaining our thought leadership may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in such effort. we rely upon the continued services of our management and employees with domain expertise with inbound marketing, sales, services, operations, and content management, and the loss of any key employees in this area could harm our competitive position and reputation. if we fail to successfully grow and maintain our thought leadership position, we may not attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers, and our business could suffer.  if we fail to further enhance our brand and maintain our existing strong brand awareness, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.  we believe that our development of the hubspot brand is critical to achieving widespread awareness of our existing and future inbound experience solutions, and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. in the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses, and we believe that this investment has resulted in strong brand recognition in the b2b market. successful promotion and maintenance of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide a reliable and useful customer platform at competitive prices. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.   if we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our customer platform may become less competitive.  our future success depends on our ability to adapt and innovate our customer platform. to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continue to enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, including ai and machine learning, which will increase our research and development costs. if we are unable to develop new applications that address our customers’ needs, or to enhance and improve our platform in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance of our platform. our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. access and use of our customer platform is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver inbound marketing software and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete.  if we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer.  high-quality education, training and customer support are important for the successful marketing, sale and use of our customer platform and for the renewal of existing customers. providing this education, training and support requires that our personnel who manage our online training resource, hubspot academy, or provide customer support have specific inbound experience domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations. the importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. if we do not help our customers use multiple applications within our customer platform and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.  we may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers’ growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.  as usage of our customer platform grows and as customers use our platform for additional inbound applications, such as sales and services, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. in addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics change over time. any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. these issues could reduce the attractiveness of our customer platform to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could impede our revenue growth and harm our reputation. even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management’s time and attention. we could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. we cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. our ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. if we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.  to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new product offerings, applications, features and enhancements to our existing customer platform. maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. if we are unable to develop our platform internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors’ research and development programs. our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business.  the development of next-generation solutions that utilize new and advanced features, including ai and machine learning, involves making predictions regarding the willingness of the market to adopt such technologies over legacy solutions. the company may be required to commit significant resources to developing new products, software and services before knowing whether such investment will result in products or services that the market will accept.  the company’s inability, for technological or other reasons, some of which may be beyond the company’s control, to enhance, develop, introduce and monetize products and services in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market  conditions or customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in its products and services not achieving market acceptance or becoming obsolete. in addition, if the company fails to deliver a compelling customer experience or accurately predict emerging technological trends and the changing needs of customers and end users, or if the features of its new products and services do not meet the demands of its customers or are not sufficiently differentiated from those of its competitors, the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.  uncertainty around new and emerging ai applications such as generative ai content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or remuneration to content creators and building systems that enable creatives to have greater control over the use of their work in the development of ai, which may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we are unable to monetize such assets. in addition, ai technologies, including generative ai, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed content to their detriment, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. developing, testing and deploying ai systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.  changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform or in the applications within our customer platform purchased or used by our customers could negatively affect our operating results.  our strategy is to sell subscriptions to our customer platform to mid-sized businesses, but we have sold and will continue to sell to organizations ranging from small businesses to enterprises. our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our customer platform, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers’ use of our platform and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. sales to enterprise customers may entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. selling to small businesses may involve greater credit risk and uncertainty. if there are changes in the mix of businesses that purchase our platform or the mix of the product plans purchased by our customers, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.we have in the past completed acquisitions and may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management’s attention, fail to meet our expectations, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations or harm our operating results.  we have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. for example, in december 2023, we acquired clearbit, a b2b data provider. we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of historical or any future acquisitions. the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.  there are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. if we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition and our management may be distracted from operating our business. we also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including: unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; incurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition; the potential loss of key employees; use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources; and use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition. acquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal and compliance liabilities, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process, including data handling and privacy violations. generally, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer. acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  in addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. if our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make charges to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.   because our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the united states, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.  a component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. we have formed several international entities and may plan to form additional entities in the future. these international operations focus primarily on sales, professional services and support, and select international locations have development teams. our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:   difficulties in maintaining our company culture with a dispersed and distant workforce;   more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal data, particularly in the european union;   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;   differing labor regulations, especially in the european union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the united states, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;   challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;   difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;   currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions;   global economic uncertainty caused by global political events;   limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;   limited or insufficient intellectual property protection;   international disputes, wars (such as the conflict between russia and ukraine and the evolving events in israel and gaza), political instability or terrorist activities and resulting economic instability;    likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, or of u.s. and international export control and sanctions regulations, which likelihood may increase with an increase of sales or operations in foreign jurisdictions and operations in certain industries; and   adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.  our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. if in the future, we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer. we continue to implement policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with u.s. laws and regulations applicable to or arising from our international business. inadequacies in our past or current compliance practices may increase the risk of inadvertent violations of such laws and regulations, which could lead to financial and other penalties that could damage our reputation and impose costs on us.  social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as ai, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability. social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as ai in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings, including early-stage generative ai features. as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. potential government regulation related to ai use and ethics  may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate ai usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in ai to be undermined, which could slow adoption of ai in our products and services. the rapid evolution of ai will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that ai is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact."
HUBS,"risks related to employee matters  if we cannot maintain our company culture as we experience changes in our workforce, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed."
HUBS,"we believe that a critical component to our success has been our company culture, which is based on transparency and personal autonomy. we have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. in 2020, we made the decision to permanently move to a hybrid workplace model, which means our employees have the option to be fully remote, work full-time from one of our offices, or work both in the office and remotely. preservation of our corporate culture has been made more difficult as the majority of our workforce has been working from home. any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. as we grow and continue to develop our company infrastructure, and experience organizational change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture and our business may be adversely impacted  we rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.  our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, including our co-founders, brian halligan and dharmesh shah, our chief executive officer, yamini rangan, and other key employees in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services, operations, content management, and general and administrative functions. from time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. we also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers and information technology personnel because of the complexity of our platform, technologies and infrastructure. we may terminate any employee’s employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause. we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel. the loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business.  the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.  to execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. in particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled information technology, marketing, sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. also, inbound sales, marketing, services, operations, and content management domain experts are very important to our success and are difficult to replace. we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. in particular, we have experienced a competitive hiring environment in the greater boston area, where we are headquartered and will continue to experience a competitive hiring environment as we recruit for remote talent worldwide. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. the change by companies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment may increase the competition for such employees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. in addition, if we choose to no longer offer a remote or hybrid work environment, we may face more difficulty in retaining our workforce. further, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, and workforce participation rates. in addition, if our reputation were to be harmed, whether as a result of media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny or otherwise, it could make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel that are critical to the success of our business.  in addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. if the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed."
HUBS,"risks related to global economic conditions  we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our financial results.    we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased, in particular with respect to the euro, british pound sterling, australian dollar, singapore dollar, japanese yen, colombian peso, and canadian dollar. fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact our operating results when translated into u.s. dollars. thus, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when re-measured, may differ materially from expectations. in addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of u.s. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. our board recently approved a hedging program intended to allow us to mitigate foreign exchange impacts, such as exposure to currency exchange rates in connection with significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, by entering into derivatives transactions such as foreign exchange forwards. once implemented, there can be no guarantee or assurance that such hedging program (or any other strategies we implement in the future to mitigate foreign currency risk) and the strategies we would employ pursuant thereto would be effective to reduce or eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to the extent we anticipate, or at all. additionally, as we anticipate growing our business further outside of the united states, the effects of movements in currency exchange rates will increase as our transaction volume outside of the united states increases."
HUBS,"weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations.  our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. global financial developments and downturns seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us. the united states and other key international economies have been affected from time to time by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, volatility in the banking sector, changes in the labor market, supply chain disruptions, bankruptcies, inflation and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy, including with respect to tariff and trade issues. moreover, a potential u.s. federal government shutdown resulting from budgetary decisions, a prolonged continuing resolution, breach of the federal debt ceiling, or a potential u.s. sovereign default and the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 u.s. presidential election may increase uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and financial markets. weak economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets related to stock market volatility, inflation, recession, changes in tariffs, trade agreements or governmental fiscal, monetary and tax policies, among others, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. further, weak market conditions have, and could in the future result in, impairment of our investments and long-lived assets. further, the economies of countries in europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector, uncertainty over the future of the euro zone and volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro and instability resulting from the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine. the effect of the conflict between russia and ukraine, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed against governmental or other entities in, for example, russia, have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets. we have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout europe. if economic conditions in europe and other key markets for our platform continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate further, it could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to subscribe to our platform, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results.  more recently, global inflation rates have increased to levels not seen in several decades, which may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increases in our operating costs, including our labor costs, constrained credit and liquidity, reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets. the federal reserve and other international government agencies have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns over inflation risk. increases in interest rates on credit and debt that would increase the cost of any borrowing that we may make from time to time and could impact our ability to access the capital markets. increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. in an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our products and services at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which could/would reduce our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and net income. we also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in consumer spending or a negative reaction to our pricing. a reduction in our revenue would be detrimental to our profitability and financial condition and could also have an adverse impact on our future growth.  there continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the federal reserve and other domestic and international government agencies, related to concerns over inflation risk. a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio and investments in some financial instruments could pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns, which could adversely affect our financial results.   the current economic downturn may lead to decreased demand for our products and services and otherwise harm our business and results of operations.  our overall performance depends, in part, on worldwide economic conditions. in recent months, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the united states and abroad. impacts of such economic weakness include:   falling overall demand for goods and services, leading to reduced profitability;   reduced credit availability;   higher borrowing costs;    reduced liquidity;    changes in the labor market;   supply chain disruptions;   volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; and    bankruptcies.   these developments could lead to inflation, higher interest rates, and uncertainty about business continuity, which may adversely affect our business and our results of operations. as our customers react to global economic conditions and the potential for a global recession, we may see them reduce spending on our products and take additional precautionary measures to limit or delay expenditures and preserve capital and liquidity. reductions in spending on our solutions, delays in purchasing decisions, lack of renewals, inability to attract new customers, as well as pressure for extended billing terms or pricing discounts, would limit our ability to grow our business and could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition."
HUBS,"risks related to our technical operations infrastructure and dependence on third parties  interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver our platform to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.  we currently serve the majority of our platform functions from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by amazon web services in the united states and europe. we also have several colocations which host certain critical services (for example, vpn access) in various locations around the world. in addition, we use cloudflare global cdn to optimize content delivery across our locations. any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our platform. despite precautions taken at our data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, such as earthquakes or hurricane, an act of terrorism, geopolitical conflict, vandalism or sabotage, a disruptive cyber attack, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, power or telecommunications failures or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on-demand software. in the event that any of our third-party facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. these factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business."
HUBS,"if our customer platform has outages or fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs.  our customer platform and its underlying infrastructure are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. we release modifications, updates, bug fixes and other changes to our software several times per day, without traditional human-performed quality control reviews for each release. we have from time to time found defects in our software and may discover additional defects in the future. we may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before customers begin to use our platform or its applications. consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our platform has been implemented. defects or errors could result in product outages and could also cause inaccuracies in the data we collect and process for our  customers, or even the loss, damage or inadvertent release of such confidential data. we implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regular system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of product outages, defects or inaccuracies in the data we collect for our customers, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of confidential data could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us. furthermore, these issues could subject us to service performance credits (whether offered by us or required by contract), warranty claims or increased insurance costs. the costs associated with product outages, any material defects or errors in our platform or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results.  in addition, third-party applications and features on our customer platform may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and, to the extent they contain bugs, vulnerabilities or defects, they may create disruptions in our customers’ use of our products, lead to data loss, unauthorized access to customer data, damage our brand and reputation and affect the continued use of our products, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  if our information technology systems, including our customer platform, have outages or fail due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, it could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price. we rely on our information technology systems, including the sustained and uninterrupted performance of our customer platform, to manage numerous aspects of our business, including marketing, sales, content management, customer service and other internal operations. our information technology systems are an essential component of our business and any disruption could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. our customer platform and its underlying infrastructure are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. we release modifications, updates, bug fixes and other changes to our software several times per day, without traditional human-performed quality control reviews for each release. while we seek to implement secure development practices, we cannot eliminate the risk that our applications may have vulnerabilities. we have from time to time found defects in our software and may discover in the future additional defects, outages, delays or cessations of service, performance and quality problems or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations, migration work or other causes, which could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. such disruptions could adversely impact our internal operations and interrupt other processes. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price.  we are dependent on the continued availability of third-party data hosting and transmission services.  a significant portion of our operating cost is from our third-party data hosting and transmission services, including amazon web services (“aws”), which hosts the substantial majority of our products and platform. if the costs for such services increase due to vendor consolidation, regulation, contract renegotiation, or otherwise, we may not be able to increase the fees for our customer platform or services to cover the changes, which could have a negative impact on our operating results.  additionally, our customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. aws runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at aws. we have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. in some instances, including because we do not control our service providers, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. additionally, as our business continues to grow, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, through our providers of cloud infrastructure, our results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, any changes in service levels from our service providers may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ requirements, result in negative publicity which could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform.  if we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our customer platform with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.  a significant percentage of our customers choose to integrate our platform with certain capabilities provided by third-party application providers using application programming interfaces (“apis”) published by these providers. the functionality and popularity of our customer platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform with third-party applications and platforms, including crm, cms, e-commerce, call center, analytics and social media sites that our customers use and from which they obtain data. third-party providers of applications and apis may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict  our access to their applications and platforms, or alter the terms governing use of their applications and apis and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our platform, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. if we fail to integrate our platform with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use for marketing, sales, services, operations, commerce, or content management purposes, or fail to renew existing relationships pursuant to which we currently provide such integration, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate new revenue or maintain existing revenue and adversely impact our business.  we rely on data provided by third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of our platform and disrupt our business.  select functionality of our customer platform depends on our ability to deliver data, including search engine results and social media updates, provided by unaffiliated third parties, such as facebook, google, linkedin and twitter. some of this data is provided to us pursuant to third-party data sharing policies and terms of use, under data sharing agreements by third-party providers or by customer consent. in the future, any of these third parties could change its data sharing policies, including making them more restrictive, or alter its algorithms that determine the placement, display, and accessibility of search results and social media updates, any of which could result in the loss of, or significant impairment to, our ability to collect and provide useful data to our customers. these third parties could also interpret our, or our service providers’ data collection policies or practices as being inconsistent with their policies, which could result in the loss of our ability to collect this data for our customers. any such changes could impair our ability to deliver data to our customers and could adversely impact select functionality of our platform, impairing the return on investment that our customers derive from using our solution, as well as adversely affecting our business and our ability to generate revenue.  privacy concerns and end users’ acceptance of internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our customer platform.  privacy concerns may cause end users to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our platform effectively. we have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect end user privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform. privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by these groups’ policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our customer platform and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action.  if our or our customers’ security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to data of our customers or their customers is otherwise obtained, our customer platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our platform, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities.  our operations involve the storage and transmission of data of our customers and their customers, including personal data. our storage is typically the sole source of record for portions of our customers’ businesses and end user data, such as initial contact information and online interactions. security incidents could result in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our customers and our business. cyber-attacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers of marketing services have been targeted. if our security measures, or those of our service providers, are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. additionally, if third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, violate applicable laws, our security policies or our acceptable use policy, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, if the security measures of our customers or our service providers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. we may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. as we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data. additionally, we provide our employees with extensive access to our databases, which store our customer data, and to our apis to facilitate our rapid pace of product development and to support our customers. if such access, unauthorized access or our own operations, cause the loss, damage, destruction or loss (including, without limitation, because of actions by a bad actor, attempts to exfiltrate customer data (which attempts we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future), our systems being compromised or unintentional or accidental disclosure, or destruction of our customers’ business data, their sales, lead generation, support and other business operations may be permanently harmed. as a result, our customers may bring claims against us for lost profits and other damages, or such concerns may cause us to limit access by our development team.  additionally, in certain of our subscription agreements with our customers, we agree to indemnify these customers against claims by a third party alleging our breach of confidentiality obligations or our misuse of customer data in violation of the subscription agreement.  cyber-attacks, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, business email compromises, computer malware, viruses, and social engineering (including phishing) are prevalent in our industry, the industries of certain of our service providers and our customers' industries. our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. accordingly, if our cybersecurity measures or those of our service providers fail to protect against unauthorized access, attacks (which may include sophisticated cyber-attacks), compromise or the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, then our reputation, customer trust, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. this risk is increased by the difficulty of balancing rapid vulnerability patching and system availability in a large and rapidly-changing production environment. at times, we may be unable to patch all of our systems in a manner that strictly adheres to our internally prescribed timelines. the techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop security breaches while they are occurring. because the techniques used by threat actors who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our computer systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. additionally, as remote work and resource access expand, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related events such as phishing attacks, exploitation of any cybersecurity flaws that may exist, an increase in the number of cybersecurity threats or attacks, and other security challenges as a result of most of our employees and our service providers continuing to work remotely from non-corporate managed networks. there is also a risk of potential increase in such attacks due to cyberwarfare in connection with the ongoing global conflicts, and this could adversely affect our and our suppliers' ability to maintain or enhance key cybersecurity and data protection measures. we have previously been, and may in the future become, the target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our or our customers' data, systems, or infrastructure, or to disrupt our operations or ability to provide our services. additionally, it is also possible that unauthorized access to sensitive customer and business data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by our customers, suppliers or other vendors, using social engineering to cause an employee or contractor to install malware or exploiting known vulnerabilities. like other businesses, we rely on hardware and software supplied by third-parties and, therefore, are susceptible to supply chain attacks. such attacks are becoming increasingly common, and we may not be able to anticipate and prevent negative impacts from such an attack. if we are impacted by a supply chain attack, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product and services could be hindered or delayed.  recent cybersecurity incidents and compromises affecting large institutions, including an incident that affected us, suggest that the risk of such events is significant, even if privacy protection and security measures are implemented and enforced. a cyber-attack could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. these cyber-attacks could be carried out by threat actors of all types (including but not limited to nation states, organized crime, other criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). in addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors. to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, incur significant costs associated with remediation and the implementation of additional security measures, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants, and our competitive position could be harmed. any breach, loss, or compromise of personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, or claims for damages either under the general data protection regulation (the “eu gdpr”), the eu gdpr as incorporated into united kingdom law, and relevant member state law in the european union, other foreign laws, and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the united states.  many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents or unauthorized transfers involving certain types of personal data. in addition, the data processing agreement we execute with our customers contractually requires us to notify them of any personal data breach. under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a data breach of payment resulting in the compromise of cardholder payment information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses depending on the cause of such data breach. data breaches and other data security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause  existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.  there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results."
HUBS,"risks related to intellectual property  our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others.  the software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual and proprietary rights. companies in the software industry, including those in marketing software, are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications and may assert patent or other intellectual property rights within the industry. moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as “patent trolls,” have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. from time to time, we may receive threatening letters or notices or may be the subject of claims that our services and/or platform and underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign our application, delay releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. additionally, our customers may not purchase our customer platform if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. the occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business."
HUBS,"in certain of our subscription agreements with customers, we agree to indemnify these customers against claims by a third party alleging infringement of a valid patent, registered copyright or registered trademark. however, whether or not a subscription agreement includes an indemnity obligation in favor of a customer, there can be no assurance that customers will not assert a common law indemnity claim or that any existing limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate, or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. our customers who are accused of intellectual property infringement may in the future seek indemnification from us under common law or other legal theories. if such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, in the united states and abroad, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.  our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. however, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. additionally, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding ai technologies, which we are increasingly building into our product offerings, has not been fully addressed by u.s. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of ai technologies in our products and services may expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims. despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our offerings may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. in addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the  same extent as the laws of the united states. to the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information may increase.  we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform and offerings.  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform and offerings, impair the functionality of our platform and offerings, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform and offerings, or injure our reputation.  our use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation.  a substantial portion of our cloud-based platform incorporates so-called “open source” software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable. certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer the components of our platform that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. if an author or other third party that distributes open source software we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the offering of the components of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer the affected software. we could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products."
HUBS,"risks related to government regulation we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base and business lines, and thereby decrease our revenue."
HUBS,"our handling of data across our products and services is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the u.s. federal trade commission (""ftc""), and various state, local and foreign agencies. we collect personal data and other data from our customers, prospects, partners, and publicly available sources. we also handle personal data about our customers’ customers. we use this information to provide services to our customers, to support, expand and improve our business. we may also share customers’ personal data with third parties as authorized by the customer or as described in our privacy policy.  the u.s. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, processing, distribution, use, storage and safeguarding of personal data. in the united states, the ftc and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state privacy and consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of personal and other data. however, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or data security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized, disclosure, release or transfer of personal data or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.   laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection and cybersecurity are rapidly evolving, and changes to such laws and regulations could require us to change features of our platform or restrict our customers’ ability to collect and use email addresses, page viewing data and other personal data, which may reduce demand for our platform. our failure to comply with federal, state and foreign privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.  for example, the california consumer privacy act (the “ccpa”), as amended by the california privacy rights act (the “cpra”), among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to california residents and afford such individuals the ability to opt out of the sales or sharing of their personal data. the ccpa may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to potentially incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. in addition to increasing our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement, the ccpa also provides for violations and a limited private right of action, which may increase our exposure to civil litigation.  other states, including virginia, colorado, utah, connecticut, iowa, indiana, montana, tennessee, and texas, among others, have passed comprehensive privacy and data security laws, which impose obligations on covered businesses similar – but not identical – to those under the ccpa. some of these laws entered into force in 2023, and others will enter into force in 2024 and beyond. a number of other states have proposed similar or sector specific privacy legislation,; and the u.s. congress is considering legislation that may preempt some or all of such u.s. state privacy laws, providing a more robust private right of action. the evolving complexity of privacy and data security legislation in the u.s. may complicate our compliance efforts and further increase our risk of regulatory enforcement, penalties and litigation.  in addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, including the european union, japan, united kingdom, canada, australia, and others have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal data obtained from their residents, which are more restrictive in certain respects than those in the u.s. laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual. in relevant part, these foreign laws and regulations may affect our ability to engage in lead generation activities by imposing heightened requirements, such as affirmative opt-ins or other consent prior to sending commercial correspondence, obtaining leads or engaging in electronic tracking activities that aid our marketing and business intelligence. we may be required to modify our policies, procedures, and data processing measures in order to address requirements under these or other privacy, data protection, or cyber security regimes, and may face claims, litigation, investigations, or other proceedings regarding them and may incur related liabilities, expenses, costs, and operational losses.  in connection with the operation of some of our business lines, such as business intelligence services, we collect, process and share business contact information or other personal data individuals make available in their professional capacity. we may be subject to additional requirements under privacy and data protection laws that could lead to additional compliance costs, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational risks that may affect our business. for example, we may be required to send notifications to individuals and respond to higher volumes of data privacy requests, which may require substantial costs and expenses, or reduce the potential value of our business intelligence services. we may also receive data from third-party vendors (e.g., data brokers) in connection with such services. while we have implemented certain contractual measures with such vendors to protect our interests, we are ultimately unable to verify with complete certainty the source of such data, how it was received, and that such information was collected and is being shared with us in compliance with all applicable data privacy laws. furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our vendors, customers, users, or our customers’ customers to decline to provide the data necessary to allow us to offer some of our services to our customers and users effectively, or could prompt individuals to opt out of our collection of their personal data. concern regarding our use of the personal data collected when performing our services could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services. within the european union, the eu gdpr, and in the united kingdom, the eu gdpr as incorporated into the laws of the united kingdom (the “uk gdpr” together with the eu gdpr, the “gdpr”), impose heightened obligations and risk upon our business and may substantially increase the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. non-compliance with the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the european union member states may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is higher.  the proliferation of privacy and data protection laws has heightened risks and uncertainties concerning cross-border transfers of personal data and other data, which could impose significant compliance costs and expenses on our business, increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, and have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers. to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the european union or united kingdom, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with data protection laws. on june 4, 2021, the european commission published new versions of its standard contractual clauses (“sccs”), which are required for all transfers of personal data from the european union to third countries (including the u.s). the united kingdom is not subject to the new sccs but has its own equivalent, being the international data transfer agreement and/or uk addendum (“idtas”). the idtas must be entered into for new contracts, but allow  for a transition period until march 21, 2024 for existing contracts. our customer agreements include the updated sccs and uk idtas. we are in the process of transitioning to the idtas for existing contracts, and doing so will require significant effort and cost. under the new sccs and idtas, companies are also required to assess the risk of a data transfer on a case-by-case basis by undertaking a transfer impact assessment, and may be required to adopt additional measures to accomplish transfers of personal data to united states and other third countries. there continue to be concerns about whether the sccs will face additional challenges.  on july 10, 2023, the european commission approved the eu-u.s. data privacy framework (“dpf”) to support transfers of personal data from the eu to companies in the u.s. because we have maintained our certification under the previously invalidated privacy shield, we have now automatically become subject to the dpf and are required to maintain policies and procedures to comply with the dpf principles. we may be subject to regulatory enforcement by the ftc if we are found to be noncompliant with any of the dpf principles, and this regulatory enforcement may lead to significant civil penalties.  until the remaining legal uncertainties regarding sccs, dpf and other transfer mechanisms are settled, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our customers will be permitted to transfer personal data to the united states for processing by us as part of our platform services. our customers may view data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us.  we publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data. although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or any applicable privacy, security or data protection, information security or consumer-protection related laws, regulations, orders or industry standards could expose us to costly litigation, significant awards, fines or judgments, civil and/or criminal penalties or negative publicity, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to claims, legal proceedings or other actions by individuals or governmental authorities based on privacy or data protection regulations and our commitments to customers or others, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our subscribers’ ability to use and share personal data or our ability to store, process and share personal data, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.  separately, as the regulatory framework for machine learning technology and ai evolves, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect our business and the ways in which we use ai and machine learning technology, our financial condition and our results of operations, including as a result of the cost to comply with such laws or regulations. further, potential government regulation related to ai use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate ai usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in ai to be undermined, which could slow adoption of ai in our products and services. we could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our customers, the content of their websites or the data they store on our servers.  as a provider of a cloud-based inbound marketing, sales and customer service software platform, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with the data they store on our servers. although our customer terms of use prohibit illegal use of our services by our customers and permit us to take down websites or take other appropriate actions for illegal use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law or the customer’s own policies, which could subject us to liability or harm our reputation. furthermore, customers may upload, store, or use content on our customer platform that may violate our policy on acceptable use which prohibits content that is threatening, abusive, harassing, deceptive, false, misleading, vulgar, obscene, or indecent. while such content may not be illegal, use of our customer platform for such content could harm our reputation resulting in a loss of business. several u.s. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various customer activities:   the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 (""dmca""), provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under u.s. copyright law have been infringed on the internet. under the dmca, based on our current business activity as an internet service provider that does not own or control website content posted by our customers, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by our customers or other third parties, provided that we follow the procedures for handling copyright infringement claims set forth in the dmca. generally, if we receive a    proper notice from, or on behalf, of a copyright owner alleging infringement of copyrighted material located on websites we host, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by the dmca, the copyright owner may seek to impose liability on us. technical mistakes in complying with the detailed dmca take-down procedures could subject us to liability for copyright infringement.   the communications decency act of 1996 (""cda""), generally protects online service providers, such as us, from liability for certain activities of their customers, such as the posting of defamatory or obscene content, unless the online service provider is participating in the unlawful conduct. under the cda, we are generally not responsible for the customer-created content hosted on our servers. consequently, we do not monitor hosted websites or prescreen the content placed by our customers on their sites. however, the cda does not apply in foreign jurisdictions and we may nonetheless be brought into disputes between our customers and third parties which would require us to devote management time and resources to resolve such matters and any publicity from such matters could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and therefore our business.   in addition to the cda, the securing the protection of our enduring and established constitutional heritage act (the ""speech act""), provides a statutory exception to the enforcement by a u.s. court of a foreign judgment for defamation under certain circumstances. generally, the exception applies if the defamation law applied in the foreign court did not provide at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press as would be provided by the first amendment of the u.s. constitution or by the constitution and law of the state in which the u.s. court is located, or if no finding of defamation would be supported under the first amendment of the u.s. constitution or under the constitution and law of the state in which the u.s. court is located. although the speech act may protect us from the enforcement of foreign judgments in the united states, it does not affect the enforceability of the judgment in the foreign country that issued the judgment. given our international presence, we may therefore, nonetheless, have to defend against or comply with any foreign judgments made against us, which could take up substantial management time and resources and damage our reputation.  although these statutes and case law in the united states have generally shielded us from liability for customer activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. in addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. also, notwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, we may become involved in complaints and lawsuits which, even if ultimately resolved in our favor, add cost to our doing business and may divert management’s time and attention. finally, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various states, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business. additionally, payments, our end-to-end payment solution built within commerce hub, are susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent or illegal sales of goods or services, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked information, bank fraud, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. while we engage a third party as our registered payment facilitator, the use of payments for illegal or improper uses may subject us to claims (including claims brought by our third-party payment processor), government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, and harm our reputation. moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including payments, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. if payments is used for illegal or improper uses, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from merchants and their buyers, including consumers. allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses. moreover, if measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud are not effective and our loss rate is higher than anticipated, payments and our business could be negatively impacted. the standards that private entities use to regulate the use of email have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our customer platform and our ability to conduct business.  our customers rely on email to communicate with their existing or prospective customers. various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. these entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. some of these entities maintain “blacklists” of companies and individuals, and the websites, internet service providers and internet protocol  addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. if a company’s internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any internet domain or internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity’s service or purchases its blacklist.  from time to time, some of our internet protocol addresses may become listed with one or more blacklisting entities due to the messaging practices of our customers. there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists. blacklisting of this type could interfere with our ability to market our customer platform and services and communicate with our customers and, because we fulfill email delivery on behalf of our customers, could undermine the effectiveness of our customers’ email marketing campaigns, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.  existing federal, state and foreign laws regulate internet tracking software, the senders of commercial emails and text messages, website owners and other activities, and could impact the use of our customer platform and potentially subject us to regulatory enforcement or private litigation.  certain aspects of how our customers utilize our platform are subject to regulations in the united states, european union and elsewhere. in recent years, u.s. and european lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies or web beacons for online behavioral advertising, and legislation adopted recently in the european union requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to restrictions on our activities, such as efforts to understand users’ internet usage. new and expanding “do not track” regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users’ right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. these regulations seek, among other things, to allow end users to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third-party websites. these policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our customer platform and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business. many of our customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our customer platform to decrease and adversely impact our financial results.  in addition, the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 (""can-spam act""), establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. the can-spam act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender. the ability of our customers’ message recipients to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of the email components of our customer platform. in addition, certain states and foreign jurisdictions, such as australia, canada and the european union, have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than u.s. laws. for example, some foreign laws prohibit sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving it. a requirement that recipients opt into, or the ability of recipients to opt out of, receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our platform.  while these laws and regulations generally govern our customers’ use of our customer platform, we may be subject to certain laws as a data processor on behalf of, or as a business associate of, our customers. for example, laws and regulations governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal data include, in the united states, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, the gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 and state breach notification laws, and internationally, the gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws. if we were found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations as a result of government enforcement or private litigation, we could be subjected to civil and criminal sanctions, including both monetary fines and injunctive action that could force us to change our business practices, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business.   we are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.  our business activities are subject to various restrictions under u.s. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the u.s. commerce department’s export administration regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit certain transactions with u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. these sanctions laws with which we must comply may also change rapidly from time to time as a result of geopolitical events, such as the recent imposition of sanctions on russia as a result of the conflict between russia and ukraine. although we take precautions to prevent transactions with u.s. sanction targets, the possibility exists that we could inadvertently provide our solutions to persons prohibited by u.s. sanctions. this could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm."
HUBS,"risks related to taxation  we may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business."
HUBS,"state, local, and non-u.s. jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added, digital service, and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. in particular, the applicability of such taxes to our customer platform in various jurisdictions can be unclear. further, these jurisdictions’ rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. as a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. a successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our application or otherwise harm our business and operating results.  changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our customer platform and adversely impact our business.  new income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. these events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. for example, under section 174 of the code, in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the united states will be capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. if we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to continue or purchase our customer platform in the future. additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers’ and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our platform. any or all of these events could adversely impact our business, cash flows and financial performance. furthermore, as our employees continue to work remotely from geographic locations across the united states and internationally, we may become subject to additional taxes and our compliance burdens with respect to the tax laws of additional jurisdictions may increase.  we are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.  as a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. the amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, or challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or operating results. in addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable nexus, often referred to as a “permanent  establishment” under international tax treaties, any of which could have a material impact on us, our financial condition or our operating results.  we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. we have incurred losses during our history and we may never achieve profitability. as of december 31, 2023, we had $861.4 million of u.s. federal and $740.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which have an indefinite carryforward and begin to expire in 2025 for state purposes. the state net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. in addition, under section 382 and section 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be further limited if we experience an “ownership change.” an ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage (by value) within a rolling three-year period. similar rules may apply under state tax laws. we may have experienced an ownership change in the past, and future issuances of our stock could cause an ownership change. it is possible that any such ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes accrued prior to such ownership change, which could adversely affect our profitability."
HUBS,"risks related to our operating results and financial condition  we have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.  we generated net losses of $176.3 million in 2023, $112.7 million in 2022, and $77.8 million in 2021. as of december 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $818.7 million. we will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. we have spent and intend to continue to expend significant funds on our marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and content management operations, develop and enhance our customer platform, scale our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and expand into new markets. our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this annual report on form 10-k, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. from time to time, we may invest funds in social impact investment funds, and may receive no return on our investment or lose our entire investment."
HUBS,"from time to time, we may invest in social impact investment funds. as of december 31, 2023, we have invested $8.5 million in the black economic development fund and $7.5 million in support of minority depository institutions to help close the racial wealth, health and opportunity gap. there is no guarantee as to the performance of this investment or any similar investments we make in the future. depending on the performance of this investment and future investments we may make, we may not receive any return on our investment or we may lose our entire investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business.  we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. as a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. in addition to the other risks described in this annual report on form 10-k, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:   changes in spending on marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and content management software by our current or prospective customers;   pricing our customer platform subscriptions effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our profitability;   attracting new customers for our marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and content management software, increasing our existing customers’ use of our platform and providing our customers with excellent customer support;    customer renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed;   global awareness of our thought leadership and brand;   changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new products or product enhancements;   changes to the commission plans, quotas and other compensation-related metrics for our sales representatives;   the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development, sales and marketing expenses and employee benefit expenses;   the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees while maintaining our company culture;   our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including increases in the number of customers on our platform and the introduction and adoption of our customer platform in new markets outside of the united states;   unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including disruptions in our hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security;   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;    rising inflation in the economies in which we operate and our ability to control costs, including operating expenses; and   general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.  we may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future subscriptions, revenue and expenses and, as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors. if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline.  if we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates or otherwise fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.  because our recent growth has resulted in the rapid expansion of our business, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of renewal rates with customers or future operating revenue. as a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.  we apply accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. changes in these rules or their interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance."
HUBS,"risks related to our notes  servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the notes or to repurchase the notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  in june 2020, we incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $460.0 million in connection with the issuance of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due june 1, 2025 (the “2025 notes”). our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash"
HUBS,"flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. in addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. in addition, holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. in addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.  in addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. for example, it could:   make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general u.s. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;   place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and   limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes.  any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.  the conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2025 notes is triggered, the holders thereof will be entitled to convert the 2025 notes at any time during specified periods at their option. because the last reported sale price of the company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended december 31, 2023 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2025 notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending december 31, 2023. as of february 9, 2024, the company has not received any material conversion notices with respect to the 2025 notes. whether the notes that remain outstanding will be convertible following the calendar quarter ended december 31, 2023 will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. if one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. in addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.  in august 2020, the fasb issued guidance simplifying the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. the new standard eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method for calculating the diluted earnings per share for convertible debt instruments. we adopted the guidance on january 1, 2022,  using the modified retrospective method. future interest expense of the convertible notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance and net loss per share will be computed using the if-converted method for these securities. the if-converted method assumes that all of the notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. the application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted net income per share to the extent we are profitable, and accounting standards may change in the future in a manner that may otherwise adversely affect our diluted net income per share.  we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call options.   in connection with the offering of the 2025 notes, we purchased capped call options (“capped call options”) with respect to our common stock for $50.6 million. the counterparties to the capped call options are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default, fail to perform or exercise their termination rights under the capped call options. global economic conditions have, from time to time, resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. if a counterparty to the capped call options becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. in addition, upon a default, failure to perform or a termination of the capped call options by a counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties."
HUBS,"risks related to our common stock  our stock price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you purchased them.  the trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including providers of software via the cloud-based model, have been highly volatile. since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in october 2014 at a price of $25.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $25.79 to $866.00 through december 31, 2023. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:"
HUBS," actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results, including as a result of the addition or loss of any number of customers;   announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;   the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;   failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates and the publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;   changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of cloud-based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular;   price and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;   sales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our notes or any other equity or equity-linked financings;   new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or industry, including data privacy and data security;   lawsuits threatened or filed against us;   changes in key personnel; and   other events or factors, including changes in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends, international disputes, wars (such as the conflict between russia and ukraine and the evolving events in israel and gaza), and political stability.   in addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.  in the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. if we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.  if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the “exchange act”), the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (the “sarbanes-oxley act”), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the “dodd-frank act”), and the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange (the “nyse”). we expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. in particular, section 404 of the  sarbanes-oxley act (“section 404”), requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. our compliance with applicable provisions of section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.  furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. irrespective of compliance with section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. if we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm. in addition, as a result of our hybrid culture, many of our employees – including those critical to maintaining an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting – are working, and are expected to continue to work, in a remote environment and not in the office environment from which they have historically performed their duties. we have limited experience maintaining effective control systems with our employees working in remote environments, and risks that we have not contemplated may arise and result in our failure to maintain effective disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting.  anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:   authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;   provide for a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;   specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;   prohibit stockholder action by written consent;   establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;   provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;   provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;   specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;   authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and   require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.  these provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.  in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.  any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for  their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock."
HUBS,"general risks  catastrophic events could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. in addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. a disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that we do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customer demands or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the covid-19 pandemic. the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as the covid-19 pandemic, may have an adverse effect on how we and our customers operate our businesses and our operating and financial results. our operations may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control, including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants and the degree of transmissibility and severity thereof. the extent to which global pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic, impact our financial condition or results of operations will depend on factors, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as whether there is a material impact on the businesses or productivity of our customers, partners, employee, suppliers and other partners. to the extent that a pandemic, such as the covid-19 pandemic, harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section, may be heightened."
HUBS,"failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.  our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states. noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions.  our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.  our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. in the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. in addition, recent volatility in capital markets and lower market prices for many securities may affect our ability to access new capital through sales of shares of our common stock or issuance of indebtedness, which may materially harm our liquidity, limit our ability to grow our business, pursue acquisitions or improve our operating infrastructure and restrict our ability to compete in our markets.  if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. if we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. furthermore, if we issue equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. the notes are and any additional equity or equity-linked financings would be dilutive to our stockholders. because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. as a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.     climate change may have a long-term impact on our business  while we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our offices globally may experience climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. while this danger has a low-assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential to disrupt employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively. furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work from home. climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on the u.s.’s, europe’s and other major regions’ critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. regulatory developments, changing market dynamics and stakeholder expectations regarding climate change may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. to inform our disclosures and take potential action as appropriate, we are working to align our reporting with emerging disclosure and accounting standards such as the financial stability board’s task force on climate-related financial disclosures, the sustainability accounting standards board and the global reporting initiative as well as potential new disclosure requirements from regulators such as the sec."
SNOW,"item 1a. risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. you should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including the sections titled “special note about forward-looking statements” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or growth prospects. in such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. you should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized. risks related to our business and operations we have experienced rapid revenue growth and have a limited operating history, both of which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations. our revenue was $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as a result of our historical rapid growth, limited operating history, and unstable macroeconomic conditions, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations, including revenue, remaining performance obligations (rpo), and the percentage of rpo we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods, is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth and platform consumption. our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance.  further, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including increased competition, changes to technology, such as changes in software or underlying cloud infrastructure or the increasing prominence of new technology like artificial intelligence, and reduced demand for our platform. for example, customers may continue to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management, including by reducing storage through shorter data retention policies and shortening committed contract durations. as a result of the foregoing and our rapid revenue growth in prior periods, our revenue growth rate has slowed in recent periods. any further declines in our revenue growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. we have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described below. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer."
SNOW,"we may not have visibility into our future financial position and results of operations. customers generally consume our platform by using compute, storage, and data transfer resources. unlike a subscription-based business model, in which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, we generally recognize revenue on consumption. because our customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition that a typical subscription-based software company has. there is a risk that customers will consume our platform at lower levels than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions or holidays. for example, during april 2023 and part of may 2023, consumption of our platform increased at a slower pace than expected. unexpected fluctuations in customer consumption may cause actual results to differ from our forecasts. as a result, our results of operations in a given period should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance."
SNOW,"  we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. we have experienced net losses in each period since inception. we generated net losses of $838.0 million, $797.5 million and $679.9 million for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $4.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. we expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods. in particular, we intend to continue to invest significant resources to further develop our platform, expand our research and development teams, retain our employees, and acquire other businesses, including in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. in addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by amazon web services (aws), microsoft azure (azure), and google cloud platform (gcp), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors. if we fail to meet any minimum commitments under these third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, we may be required to pay the difference, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. we will also incur increased general and administrative expenses associated with our growth, including costs related to internal systems, operating as a public company, and targeting regulated industries or markets. our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, or our revenue growth rate may be slower than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset the increase in operating expenses resulting from these investments. if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, or if we are unable to achieve the revenue growth that we expect from these investments, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease. the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving increased use of our platform by existing customers. the markets in which we operate are rapidly evolving and highly competitive. as these markets continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets, we expect competition to intensify. our current competitors include:"
SNOW," large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including aws, azure, and gcp;  less-established public and private cloud companies with products that compete in some of our markets;  other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and  new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies. we compete based on various factors, including price, performance, breadth of use cases, multi-cloud availability, brand recognition and reputation, customer support, and differentiated capabilities, including ease of implementation and data migration, ease of administration and use, scalability and reliability, data governance, security and compatibility with existing standards, programming languages, and third-party products. many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do, and may be able to respond more effectively than us to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements, and buying practices. in addition, we may not be able to respond to market opportunities as quickly as smaller companies. we currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by aws, azure, and gcp, which are also some of our primary competitors. currently, a substantial majority of our business is run on the aws public cloud. there is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use its respective control of its public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products, provide us unfavorable pricing, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently with respect to terms and conditions or regulatory requirements than it would treat its similarly situated customers. further, they have the resources to acquire, invest in, or partner with existing and emerging providers of competing technology and thereby accelerate adoption of those competing technologies. all of the foregoing could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide products and services that compete favorably with those of the public cloud providers. for all of these reasons, competition may negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers and maintain and grow use of our platform, or it may put downward pressure on our prices and gross margins, any of which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition."
SNOW,"  if we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. we compete in markets that evolve rapidly. we believe that the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases of cloud data platforms on a broad range of factors, including performance and scale, markets addressed, types of data processed, ease of data ingress and egress, user experience and programming languages, use of artificial intelligence, and data governance and regulatory compliance. we introduced data warehousing on our platform in 2014 as our core use case, and our customers subsequently began using our platform for additional workloads, including data lake, data engineering, ai/ml, applications, collaboration, cybersecurity, and unistore. our future success depends on our ability to continue to innovate rapidly and effectively and increase customer adoption of our platform and the data cloud, including the snowflake marketplace and snowpark. further, the value of our platform to customers is increased to the extent they are able to use it to process and access all types of data. we need to continue to invest in technologies, services, and partnerships that increase the types of data available and processed on our platform and the ease with which customers can ingest data into our platform. we must also continue to enhance our data sharing and marketplace capabilities so customers can share their data with internal business units, customers, and other third parties, acquire additional third-party data and data products to combine with their own data in order to gain additional business insights, and develop and monetize applications on our platform. as we develop, acquire, and introduce new services and technologies, including those that may incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical, and other challenges. in addition, our platform requires third-party public cloud infrastructure to operate. currently, we use public cloud offerings provided by aws, azure, and gcp. we will need to continue to innovate to optimize our offerings for these and other public clouds that our customers require, particularly as we expand internationally. further, the markets in which we compete are subject to evolving industry standards and regulations, resulting in increasing data governance and compliance requirements for us and our customers and partners. to the extent we expand further into the public sector and highly regulated countries and industries, our platform and operations may need to address additional requirements specific to those markets, including data sovereignty requirements.  if we are unable to enhance our platform or operations to keep pace with these rapidly evolving customer requirements, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. if we are not successful in executing our investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, including generative ai technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. we are investing significantly in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, or ai technology. our investments include internally developing ai technology, acquiring companies with complementary ai technology, and partnering with companies to bring ai technology to our platform. our competitors are pursuing similar opportunities. these competitors may, as a result of greater resources, branding, or otherwise, develop, adopt and implement ai technology faster or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our successful development of ai technology depends on our access to gpus, which are currently in high demand. it is also possible that our investments in ai technology do not result in the benefits we anticipate, or enable us to maintain our competitive advantage, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. for example, we may not accurately anticipate market demand or offer ai technology that amplifies our core data platform.    if we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities. our platform processes, stores, and transmits our own sensitive data as well as customers’ and partners’ proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, such as personal information, protected health information, and financial data. our platform is built on the infrastructure of third-party public cloud providers, such as aws, azure, and gcp. we also use third-party service providers, sub-processors, and technology to help us deliver services to our customers and their end-users, as well as for our internal business operations. these third-party providers may process, store, or transmit data of our employees, partners, customers, and customers’ end-users or may otherwise be used to help operate our technology. some of this third-party technology, including open-source software, could be used as an attack vector. even though we may not control the security measures of these vendors, we may be responsible for any breach of such measures. threats to information systems and data come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” internal and external personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. we and the third parties on which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving cyber threats, including unauthorized intrusions, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, business email compromises, computer malware, social engineering attacks (including through deep fakes and phishing), internal and external personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software vulnerabilities, software or hardware disruptions or failures, and attacks enhanced or facilitated by ai technology, all of which are prevalent in our industry and our customers’ and partners’ industries. furthermore, future business expansions, acquisitions or partnerships could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. the techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our and our third-party providers’ platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or processed, or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. in addition, ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and severe, and we may be unwilling or unable to make ransom payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. in general, cybersecurity breaches or security vulnerabilities could lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, diversion of funds, unexpected service interruptions, increased insurance costs, and other harm to our business, reputation, and competitive position. while we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. we are a target of threat actors seeking unauthorized access to our or our customers’ or partners’ systems or data or to disrupt our operations or ability to provide our services. threat actors may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities utilized by our third-party service providers. while we take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information security systems (such as our hardware and software, including that of third parties upon which we rely), we may be unable in the future to detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities on a timely basis. any security breach of our platform, our operational systems, our software (including open-source software), our physical facilities, or the systems of our third-party service providers or sub-processors, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation and remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management’s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business. security breaches and consequences from breaches, including negative publicity, may also prevent or cause customers to stop using our products, deter new customers from using our products, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business. we have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. for example, sec rules require disclosure on form 8-k of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of such incident. determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable may not be straightforward and any such mandatory disclosures are costly and could lead to negative publicity, loss of customer or partner confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management’s attention, governmental investigations, and the expenditure of significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach.   a security incident may also cause us to breach, or lead to claims that we have breached, customer contracts or other legal obligations. as a result, we could be subject to legal action (including the imposition of fines or penalties) and our customers could end their relationships with us. furthermore, there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. litigation and regulatory actions resulting from security breaches or related to our information security practices may adversely affect our business. unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our customers, our customers’ end-users, or other relevant stakeholders, or investigations, inquiries, or actions by regulators. we may be subject to, and have received in the past, requests by regulators for information about our security practices, experiences, and issues. alleged failures, problems, or issues related to our information security, including following such information requests, could result in formal investigations or actions from a variety of regulators, including state attorneys general, the federal trade commission (ftc), the sec, and others. these proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management’s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation. we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business.  our insurance coverage may not be adequate for data security, indemnification obligations, or other liabilities. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements) could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. risks related to our systems and security breaches are likely to increase as we continue to expand our platform and geographic footprint, grow our customer and partner base, and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of data.  in addition, some of our employees work remotely, including while traveling for business, which increases our cybersecurity risk, creates data accessibility concerns, and makes us more susceptible to security breaches or business disruptions. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. we could suffer disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies. our business depends on our platform being available without disruption. we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform and with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which our platform relies. these problems can be caused by a variety of factors, including introductions of new functionality, vulnerabilities, and defects in proprietary and open-source software, human error or misconduct, natural disasters (such as tornadoes, earthquakes, or fires), capacity constraints, design limitations, denial of service attacks, or other security-related incidents. further, if our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers are terminated, suspended, or suffer a material change to which we are unable to adapt, such as the elimination of services or features on which we depend, we could be unable to provide our platform and could experience significant delays and incur additional expense in transitioning customers to a different public cloud provider. any disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies, or any material change in our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers, could result in reduced use of our platform, increased expenses, including service credit obligations, and harm to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   we expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price could decline. our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. as a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. in addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:"

SNOW," health epidemics or pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic;  the impact, or timing of our adoption, of new accounting pronouncements;  changes in regulatory or legal environments, including the interpretation or enforcement of regulatory or legal requirements, that may cause us to incur, among other things, expenses associated with compliance;  the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the united states and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in our business;  the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period in which such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;  rising inflation and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated or measured in foreign currencies;  fluctuations or impairments in, or the full loss of, the market values of our strategic investments or of our portfolio, including changes to the value or accessibility of our cash and cash equivalents as a result of economic conditions or bank failures;  fluctuations in interest rates;  changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers; and  significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform. any of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly or be adversely affected. if our results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class actions. failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform. we must increase the productivity of our sales and marketing organization to increase our sales to new and existing customers. it requires significant time and resources to effectively onboard new sales and marketing personnel and to train new and existing personnel so they are able to successfully sell our product. we also plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs that are industry-specific and focused on large organizations. once a new customer begins using our platform, our sales team needs to focus on expanding consumption with that customer. all of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts generate increases in revenue that are smaller than anticipated. we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective."
SNOW,"  sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations. sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller organizations, such as longer sales cycles, stronger customer leverage in negotiating pricing and other terms, more complex customer requirements, including our ability to partner with third parties that advise such customers or help them integrate their it solutions, substantial upfront sales costs, less predictability in completing some of our sales, and higher customer support expectations. for example, large customers may require considerable time to evaluate and test our platform or new features prior to making a purchase decision. in addition, large customers may be switching from legacy on-premises solutions when purchasing our products, and may rely on third parties with whom we do not have relationships when making purchasing decisions. a number of factors also influence the length and variability of our sales cycle, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our platform, the renegotiation of existing agreements to cover additional workloads, changing laws, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles, and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes. as a result, the length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to deal closure, may vary significantly from customer to customer, with sales to large enterprises typically taking longer to complete. we have also historically seen consumption growth from large enterprises take longer than when compared to smaller enterprises. moreover, large customers often begin to deploy our products on a limited basis but nevertheless demand implementation services and negotiate pricing discounts, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that sales to these customers will justify our substantial upfront investment. if we fail to effectively manage these risks associated with sales cycles and sales to large customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected. unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in cloud spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations. our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. negative conditions or volatility in the general economy both in the united states and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, bank failures, international trade relations, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations, or the existence of pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare, or terrorist attacks on the united states, europe, the asia-pacific region, japan, or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on cloud technologies, and negatively affect the growth of our business. for example, the ongoing hamas-israel and the russia-ukraine conflicts have created volatility in the global capital markets and could have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. in addition, unfavorable conditions in the general economy may negatively impact our customers’ budgets or cash flow, which could impact the contract terms, including payment terms, our customers demand from us. competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices in an attempt to attract our customers. we cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry."
SNOW,"our growth depends on the development, expansion, and success of our partner relationships. as part of our vision for the data cloud, we will need to grow and maintain a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers. the relationships we have with these partners, and that our partners have with our customers, provide our customers with enhanced value from our platform and the data cloud, including the snowflake marketplace. our future growth will be increasingly dependent on the success of these relationships, and if we are unsuccessful in growing and maintaining these relationships or the types and quality of data and data applications supported by or available for consumption on our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected."
SNOW,"  additionally, a small but increasing portion of our revenue is generated as a result of our relationships with global system integrators, managed service providers, and resellers. increasingly, we and our customers rely on these partners to provide professional services, including customer implementations and migrations from legacy solutions, and there may not be enough qualified partners available, or we may not be able to develop or maintain relationships with enough partners, to meet customer demand. while we provide our partners with training and other enablement programs, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently, and our return on these investments may be lower than expected. in addition, new partners may require extensive training or significant time and resources to achieve productivity. if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of these partners, or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their interactions with our customers, our ability to attract and retain new customers and expand customer consumption of our platform may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed. if we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results will be harmed. our professional services business, which performs implementation services for our customers, has grown larger and more complex as our product revenue has increased. we believe our future success depends in part on investment in professional services to facilitate customer code conversion and migration from legacy solutions and adoption of our platform, especially with large enterprises. as a result, our sales efforts have and will continue to be focused on helping our customers more quickly realize the value of our platform and the data cloud rather than on the profitability of our professional services business. we price our professional services based on the anticipated cost of those services and, as a result, we expect to improve the gross profit percentage of our professional services business over time. if we are unable to manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results, including our profit margins, will be harmed. if we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain the executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed. our success depends in part on the continued services of our executive officers, as well as our other key employees in the areas of research and development and sales and marketing. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or other key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. our executive officers and other key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. for example, in february 2024, frank slootman retired as chief executive officer and we appointed sridhar ramaswamy to replace him. the loss of one or more of our executive officers could harm morale, cause additional personnel to depart, or introduce operational delays or risks as successor executives learn our business, each of which could harm our operating results. in addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based data platform products, including products with artificial intelligence capabilities and experienced sales, customer support, and professional services personnel. we also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the sophistication of our platform.   in order to continue to hire and retain highly qualified personnel, we will need to continue to hire in new locations around the world and manage return to work and remote working policies, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. from time to time, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and can provide higher compensation and benefits. in addition, we require the majority of our employees to work from a physical office, while certain of our competitors allow remote work environments. in addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. if the actual or perceived value of our equity awards declines or continues to experience significant volatility, or if our existing employees receive significant proceeds from liquidating their previously vested equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. furthermore, current and prospective employees may believe that their equity award offers have limited upside, and our competitors may be able to offer more appealing compensation packages. in order to retain our existing employees and manage potential attrition, including as a result of any stock price decreases and market volatility that impact the actual or perceived value of our equity awards, we may issue additional equity awards or provide our employees with increased cash compensation, which could negatively impact our results of operations and be dilutive to stockholders. finally, if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached our or their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. we also believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. as our workforce becomes larger and more distributed around the world, we may not be able to maintain important aspects of our culture. any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed."
SNOW,"if the availability of our platform does not meet our service-level commitments to our customers, our current and future revenue may be negatively impacted. we typically commit to our customers that our platform will maintain a minimum service-level of availability. if we are unable to meet these commitments, we may be obligated to provide customers with additional capacity at no cost, which could significantly affect our revenue. we rely on public cloud providers, such as aws, azure, and gcp, and any availability interruption in the public cloud could result in us not meeting our service-level commitments to our customers. in some cases, we may not have a contractual right with our public cloud providers that compensates us for any losses due to availability interruptions in the public cloud. further, any failure to meet our service-level commitments could damage our reputation and adoption of our platform, and we could face loss of revenue from reduced future consumption of our platform. any service-level failures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we assume liability for data breaches, intellectual property infringement, and other claims, which exposes us to substantial potential liability.  in our customer contracts, we assume liability for security breaches and data protection claims caused by us and by certain third parties on which we rely. our contracts with customers, investors, and other third parties may also include indemnification provisions under which we agree to defend and indemnify them against claims and losses arising from alleged infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property rights and for other matters. although we attempt to limit our liability and indemnity obligations and negotiate corresponding liability and indemnification rights with vendors that would require them to contribute to our indemnity obligations, we may not be successful in doing so, and an event triggering our liability or indemnity obligations could give rise to multiple claims involving multiple customers or other third parties. there is no assurance that our applicable insurance coverage, if any, would cover, in whole or in part, any such liability or indemnity obligations. we may be liable for up to the full amount of the contractual claims, which could result in substantial liability or material disruption to our business or could negatively impact our relationships with customers or other third parties, reduce demand for our platform, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations."
SNOW,"  acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, and platform technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technology, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. for example, during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, we acquired several companies, including samooha, inc., a privately-held company which developed data clean room technology; neeva inc., a privately-held internet search company which leveraged generative artificial intelligence; mountain us corporation (f/k/a mobilize.net corporation), a privately-held company which provided a suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the data cloud; and leapyear technologies, inc., a privately-held company which provided a differential privacy platform. any such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. in particular, we may encounter difficulties or unexpected costs assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, or otherwise. any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in the synergies or other benefits we expect to achieve, which could result in substantial impairment charges. these transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, we may inherit commitments, risks, and liabilities of companies that we acquire that we are unable to successfully mitigate and that may be amplified by our existing business. finally, our acquisitions or investments may result in disputes or litigation, including in connection with the achievement of earnouts. as part of our corporate development program, we invest in companies to support our key business initiatives. these companies range from early, growth stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams. our strategic investments are subject to risk of inability to achieve the desired strategic synergies and partial or total loss of investment capital. furthermore, our competitors may invest in these companies alongside us, and may obtain information about our corporate development program or other business plans. the financial success of our investment is typically dependent on an exit in favorable market conditions. to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failure to achieve strategic business objectives as well as failure to achieve a favorable exit, we could recognize an impairment or loss on all or part of our investment. in addition, in certain cases we may be required to consolidate one or more of our strategic investee’s financial results into ours. fluctuations in any such investee’s financial results, due to general market conditions, bank failures, or otherwise, could negatively affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the price of our common stock. if one or more of such investees fails to timely provide us with information necessary for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures, we may be unable to report our financial results in a timely manner, which would negatively affect our business and the price of our common stock.   seasonality may cause fluctuations in our remaining performance obligations or in customer consumption. historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. as a result, we have historically seen higher non-gaap free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. although we seek to moderate our cash outflows with our cash receipts, we may not be successful in doing so, particularly since we expect this seasonality to become more pronounced as we continue to target large enterprise customers based on their procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles. in addition, while consumption is typically lower during holidays, the magnitude of any decrease is difficult to predict and that may result in inaccurate financial guidance. for more information about non-gaap free cash flow, including a definition of non-gaap free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), see the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” we do business with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies, and heavily regulated organizations; as a result, we face risks related to the procurement process, budget, delays, and product decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements. we provide our platform to the u.s. government, state and local governments, foreign governments, and heavily regulated organizations directly and through our partners. we have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the government sector, including obtaining government certifications. however, government certification requirements may change, we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more required government certifications, or we may be required to make unexpected changes to our business or products to obtain or sustain such certifications. as a result, our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we satisfy the requirements of such certifications. a substantial majority of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners. doing business with government entities, whether directly or indirectly, presents a variety of risks. many government entities need significant education regarding our business model, as well as the uses and benefits of our platform. the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive and time-consuming, and government decisions about their procurement needs may, in certain circumstances, be subject to political influence. to pursue these opportunities, we incur significant up-front time and expense, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs, without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor or reseller) will win a contract. beyond this, demand for our platform may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown. further, if we or our partners are successful in receiving a competitive contract award, that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders in a legal action known as a “bid protest.” bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining or preserving contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. in the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. as a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of entering into customer agreements with government entities or with our distribution and reseller partners in the government market.   in addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory, or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or default. if a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for platform consumption prior to termination and settlement expenses. if a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities. further, entities providing products or services to governments, whether directly or indirectly, are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. such laws, regulations, and contractual provisions impose compliance obligations that are more burdensome than those typically encountered in commercial contracts, and they often give customers in the government market substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. these rights and remedies may relate to intellectual property, price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, incident notification, and termination rights. in addition, governments may use procurement requirements as an alternative to lawmaking, and impose stricter requirements than would apply to the commercial sector in areas that are not directly related to the purchase. these rules and requirements may apply to us or third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. such parties’ non-compliance could result in repercussions for us with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues. in addition, federal, state, and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions. if, as a result of an audit or investigation, it is determined that we have failed to comply with applicable requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits or payments we have received, costs associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, and we may suffer reputational harm. further, we are increasingly investing in doing business with customers and partners in heavily regulated industries, such as the financial services and health care industries. existing and prospective customers, such as those in these industries, may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with using and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding third-party vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers. in addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward third-party vendors generally, or our company in particular, that we may not be able to, or may choose not to, meet. we may make special compliance commitments that are more expensive to satisfy than we anticipate, or that we are unable to satisfy. in addition, customers in these heavily regulated areas and their regulators often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products, and practices. in the event that one or more customers or their regulators determine that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements, we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business. our customers also include a number of non-u.s. governments, to which similar procurement, budgetary, contract, and audit risks of u.s. government contracting also apply, particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established. such sales may also heighten our exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws. in addition, compliance with complex regulations, security certifications, and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant financial and management resources. in certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. further, our business and results of operations will be harmed if our efforts to do business with governments and heavily regulated organizations do not generate the anticipated increases in revenue. each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.   any litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend. from time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims, including claims related to the loss of employee equity grants upon termination, intellectual property claims, or securities class actions or other claims related to volatility in the trading price of our common stock. for example, we are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our initial public offering (ipo). see the section titled “legal proceedings” for more information. litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements). a claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, potentially harming our business, financial position, and results of operations. in addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners, and our customers operate.  our platform and the public cloud infrastructure on which our platform relies are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber attacks, military conflict or war, terrorist attacks, criminal acts, sabotage, other intentional acts of vandalism and misconduct, geopolitical events, and epidemics or pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic. some of our u.s. corporate offices in which we operate and certain of the public cloud data centers on which our platform runs are located in the san francisco bay area and pacific northwest, regions known for seismic activity. despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our facilities or the facilities of our public cloud providers could result in disruptions, outages, and other performance and quality problems."
SNOW,"our customers are also subject to the risk of catastrophic events. if those events occur, demand for our platform may decrease.  if we are unable to develop and maintain adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans if such an event occurs, our business could be seriously harmed.  our current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion, creating a variety of operational challenges. a component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. customer accounts outside the united states generated 23% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. for example, we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with new partners in order to expand into certain countries, including china, and if we fail to identify, establish, and maintain such relationships, we may be unable to execute on our expansion plans. we expect that our international activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources. our current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:  slower than anticipated public cloud adoption by international businesses;  changes in a specific country’s or region’s political, economic, or legal and regulatory environment, including the effects of pandemics, tariffs, trade wars, sanctions, or long-term environmental risks;  the need to adapt and localize our platform for china and other countries, including as a result of data sovereignty requirements, and the engineering and related costs that we may incur when making those changes;"
SNOW,"   greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;  unexpected changes in, or the selective application of, trade relations, regulations, or laws;  new, evolving, and more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security, data localization, and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;"
SNOW," new, evolving, and potentially more stringent regulations relating to ai technology;  differing and potentially more onerous labor regulations where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the united states, including regulations governing terminations in locations that do not permit at-will employment and deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations;  challenges inherent in efficiently managing, and the increased costs associated with, an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;  difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, and regulatory systems;  increased travel, real estate, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with international operations, including increased costs associated with changing and potentially conflicting environmental regulations and requirements;  currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue, rpo, and expenses, and the cost and risk of utilizing mitigating derivative transactions and entering into hedging transactions to the extent we do so in the future;  limitations on, or charges or taxes associated with, our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;  laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;  limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining, protecting, or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks and patents;  political instability, military conflict or war, or terrorist activities;  exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (fcpa), u.s. bribery laws, the u.k. bribery act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;   burdens of complying with laws and regulations related to taxation; and  regulations, adverse tax burdens, and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult or costly to repatriate earnings and cash. we expect to invest substantial time and resources to further expand our international operations, and, if we are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer. as we prepare to offer our platform to chinese affiliates of certain multi-national customers, risks associated with economic, political, and social events in china could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. we are currently preparing to offer our platform to chinese affiliates of certain multi-national customers. under chinese law, we must offer our platform through a chinese-owned operating partner, which must assume control and management of certain aspects of our platform and serve as the seller of record. this requires a new operating and go-to-market model, and there is a risk that functionality or customer experience may suffer and that we may incur liability or brand impairment arising from the operating partner’s actions or inactions. in addition, developing and operationalizing this new model is a significant investment and may not generate expected returns. we may also encounter the following risks:"
SNOW,"   uncertainty regarding the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection for intellectual property rights in china and the practical difficulties of enforcing such rights;  inability to secure our intellectual property and other proprietary information located in china from unauthorized access or theft;  heightened risks of cyber incidents, which could lead to the unauthorized access to or exposure of customer data;   inability to comply with extensive and evolving chinese laws that are often ambiguous or inconsistently enforced;  changes in tax regulations that may impact the economics of our china operating model;   economic or political instability;  a slowdown in china’s economy; and   a government-controlled foreign exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the chinese yuan to other currencies. further, geopolitical and national security tensions between china and the united states or other countries could lead to further restrictions on our ability to operate in china, increased scrutiny of our business operations in china, or unwillingness of certain customers to do business with us, including the u.s. federal government.  due to these and other risks, our operations in china may be more expensive or difficult than anticipated or they may fail, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects."
SNOW,"we may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. we have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including our ipo, and payments received from our customers. we cannot be certain if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. we intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility and general economic instability. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. if we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to repurchase stock and pay dividends on our common stock. furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. as a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to invest and hold our cash. our sales are currently denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, british pounds, australian dollars, and brazilian reals, and will likely be denominated in other currencies in the future. because we report our results of operations and revenue in u.s. dollars, we currently face exposure to foreign currency translation risk and may in the future face other foreign currency risks. if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. for example, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform to international customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, as our international operations expand, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states. these operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. exposure to these risks and fluctuations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows."
SNOW,"  if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. risks related to our intellectual property our intellectual property rights may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage. to be successful, we must protect our technology and brand in the united states and other jurisdictions through trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, service marks, invention assignments, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property rights and confidentiality procedures. despite our efforts to implement these protections, they may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage for a variety of reasons, including:  the failure by us to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights for important innovations or maintain appropriate confidentiality and other protective measures to establish and maintain our trade secrets;  to the extent a customer or partner owns any intellectual property created through a professional services engagement, our inability to use or monetize that intellectual property as part of our business;"
SNOW," uncertainty in, and evolution of, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights;  potential invalidation of our intellectual property rights through administrative processes or litigation;  our inability to detect infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by third parties;   uncertainty regarding the applicability of intellectual property protections to ai technology (including outputs generated from ai technology); and  other practical, resource, or business limitations on our ability to enforce our rights. further, the laws of certain foreign countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets, such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the united states. as a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, data sets, or other sensitive information. our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could seriously harm our business. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us. if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected."
SNOW,"  we may become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business. we compete in markets where there are a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights, as well as disputes regarding infringement of these rights. in addition, many of the holders of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights have extensive intellectual property portfolios and greater resources than we do to enforce their rights. as compared to our large competitors, our patent portfolio is relatively undeveloped and may not provide a material deterrent to such assertions or provide us with a strong basis to counterclaim or negotiate settlements. further, to the extent assertions are made against us by entities that hold patents but are not operating companies, our patent portfolio may not provide deterrence because such entities are not concerned with counterclaims."
SNOW,"any intellectual property litigation to which we become a party may require us to do one or more of the following:  cease selling, licensing, or using products, features, or data sets that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate;  require us to change the name of our products or services;  make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages, including indemnification of third parties;  obtain a license or enter into a royalty agreement, either of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, in order to obtain the right to sell or use the relevant intellectual property; or  redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible. intellectual property litigation is typically complex, time consuming, and expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. it may also result in adverse publicity, which could harm our reputation and ability to attract or retain employees, customers, or partners. as we grow, we may experience a heightened risk of allegations of intellectual property infringement. an adverse result in any litigation claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. if we use open-source software inconsistent with our policies and procedures or the license terms applicable to such software, we could be subject to legal expenses, damages, or costly remediation or disruption to our business.  we use open-source software in our platform and in our professional service engagements. from time to time, companies that use third-party open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open-source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open-source license. we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open-source licensing terms. additionally, while we have policies and procedures in place designed to govern our use of open-source software, there is a risk that we may incorporate open-source software with onerous licensing terms, including the obligation to make our source code available for others to use or modify without compensation to us, or inadvertently use third-party open-source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. if we receive an allegation that we have violated an open-source license, we may incur significant legal expenses, be subject to damages, be required to redesign our product to remove the open-source software or publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, or be required to comply with onerous license restrictions, all of which could have a material impact on our business. even in the absence of a claim, if we discover the use of open-source software inconsistent with our policies, we could expend significant time and resources to replace the open-source software or obtain a commercial license, if available. all of these risks are heightened by the fact that the ownership of open-source software can be uncertain, leading to litigation, and many of the licenses applicable to open-source software have not been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be construed to impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. any use of open-source software inconsistent with our policies or licensing terms could harm our business and financial position."
SNOW,
SNOW,"risks related to our tax, legal, and regulatory environment we are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data, including data privacy and security, and the failure or perceived failure to comply with these obligations could result in significant fines and liability or otherwise result in substantial harm to our business and prospects. we are subject to data privacy and protection laws, regulations, guidance, external and internal policies and other documentation, industry standards, certifications, and contractual and other obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, use, and other processing of personal information. these obligations are rapidly evolving, extensive, complex, and include inconsistencies and uncertainties. examples of recent and anticipated developments that have impacted or could impact our business include the following:  the european union’s (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the united kingdom’s general data protection regulation established strict requirements applicable to the handling of personal information.   the eu has proposed the regulation on privacy and electronic communications, which, if adopted, would impose new obligations on using personal information in the context of electronic communications, particularly with respect to online tracking technologies and direct marketing.  certain other jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal information transfer laws, such as brazil and china, which could make it more difficult for us to transfer personal information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal or other sensitive information that originates in the eu or china), or to enable our customers to transfer or replicate their data across jurisdictions using our platform. existing mechanisms that may facilitate cross-border personal information transfers may change or be invalidated. an inability or material limitation on our ability to transfer personal data to the united states or other countries could materially impact our business operations and revenue.  in the united states, federal, state, and local governments have enacted or proposed data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. additionally, in the past few years, numerous u.s. states—including california, virginia, colorado, connecticut, and utah—have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making and, if exercised, may adversely impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. these state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. for example, the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), as amended by the california privacy rights act of 2020 (cpra), provides increased privacy rights and protections, including the ability of individuals to opt out of specific disclosures of their personal information, and provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. other u.s. states have adopted, or are considering adopting, similar laws.  the certifications we may maintain and the standards that may apply to our business, such as the u.s. federal risk and authorization management program (fedramp), u.s. department of defense impact level 4 (il4), payment card industry data security standards (pci-dss), international organization for standardization (iso)/international electrotechnical commission (iec) 27001, health information trust alliance common security framework (hi-trust csf), stateramp, among others, are becoming more stringent.  we may also become subject to new laws that specifically regulate non-personal data. for example, we may become subject to certain parts of the european union’s data act, which imposes certain data and cloud service interoperability and switching obligations to enable users to switch between cloud service providers without undue delay or cost, as well as certain requirements concerning cross-border international transfers of, and governmental access to, non-personal data outside the european economic area.    these and other similar legal and regulatory developments could contribute to legal and economic uncertainty, increase our exposure to liability, affect how we design, market, and sell our platform, and how we operate our business, how our customers and partners process and share data, how we process and use data, and how we transfer personal data from one jurisdiction to another, any of which could increase our costs, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and/or negatively impact the types of data available on or the demand for our platform. it is possible that new laws may be adopted or existing laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. we may incur substantial costs to comply with such laws and regulations, to meet the demands of our customers relating to their own compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to establish and maintain internal policies, self-certifications, and third-party certifications supporting our compliance programs. our customers may delegate certain of their gdpr compliance or other privacy law obligations to us, and we may otherwise be required to expend resources to assist our customers with such compliance obligations.  although we endeavor to comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, any actual or perceived non-compliance with such obligations by us or our third-party service providers and sub-processors could result in proceedings, investigations, or claims against us by regulatory authorities, customers, or others, leading to reputational harm, higher liability and indemnity obligations, significant fines, litigation costs, additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal information, orders to destroy or not use personal information, limitations in our ability to develop or commercialize our platform, inability to process personal information or operate in certain jurisdictions, and other damages. for example, if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the gdpr or u.k. gdpr, we may be subject to fines of up to (i) 20.0 million euros or 17.5 million british pounds, as applicable, or (ii) 4% of our worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater, as well as potential data processing restrictions and penalties. in addition, private plaintiffs have become increasingly active in bringing privacy- and information security-related claims against companies, including class action claims. some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for significant statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. even if we are not determined to have violated these laws and other obligations, investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity. in addition, any failure by us or our third-party service providers and sub-processors to comply with applicable obligations could result in proceedings against us. certain regulators, such as the ftc, may prohibit our use of certain personal information as a result of such proceedings. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  we publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our security program and our collection, processing, use, and disclosure of personal information or other confidential information. although we endeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we or our vendors may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. claims by regulators or private parties that we have not followed our published documentation or otherwise violated individuals’ privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. issues in the development and use of ai technology, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. the legal and regulatory landscape applicable to ai technology is uncertain and is evolving rapidly, which may result in new and enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality, privacy or security risks, ethical concerns, legal liability, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results. for example, states, regions, and supranational bodies, including the european union and the united states, have passed or proposed new rules and regulations related to the use or sale of ai technology. these regulations may impose onerous obligations related to our development, offering, and use of ai technology and expose us to an increased risk of regulatory enforcement and litigation. if we cannot use ai technology or that use is restricted, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage.   in particular, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the applications of intellectual property and privacy laws to ai technology. intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding ai technology have not been fully addressed by courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and our use of ai technology or adoption of ai technology into our products and services may result in disputes with respect to ownership or intellectual property, or exposure to claims of copyright or other intellectual property misappropriation. in addition, our ai technology may involve the processing of personal and other sensitive data and may be subject to laws, policies, legal obligations, and contractual requirements related to privacy, data protection, and information security. certain privacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to obtain consent or delete certain personal data) and regulate automated decision making. an alleged or actual failure to meet these obligations may lead to regulatory investigations and fines or penalties; may require us to change our business practices or retrain our algorithms; or may prevent or limit our use of ai technology. for example, the ftc has required other companies to turn over or disgorge valuable insights or trainings generated through the use of ai technology where they allege the company has violated privacy and consumer protection laws, meaning that we would be unable to use that data in our ai technology. it is also possible that we are held liable for intellectual property, privacy, or other legal violations of third-party ai technology that we use, and that we may not have full recourse for any damages that we suffer (for example, our use of third-party ai technology may be subject to limitations of liability or provide no liability coverage (e.g., free or open-source technology)).  the algorithms or training methodologies used in the ai technology we use or offer may be flawed. datasets may be overly broad, insufficient, or contain inappropriately biased information. our generative ai technology may also generate outputs that are inaccurate, misleading, harmful, or otherwise flawed. this may happen if the inputs that the model relied on were inaccurate, incomplete, or flawed (including if a bad actor “poisons” the model with bad inputs or logic), or if the logic of the algorithm is flawed (a so-called “hallucination”). our customers or others may rely on or use such outputs to their detriment, or it may lead to adverse outcomes, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. finally, if we enable or offer services or technologies that draw scrutiny or controversy, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability.  we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are subject to the fcpa, u.s. domestic bribery laws, the u.k. bribery act 2010, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct business. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. as we increase our international sales, including in china, and sales to the public sector, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market or resell our products and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. in addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, there is a risk that our employees, agents, and other third parties with which we do business, including reseller and system integrator partners, will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we expand internationally and into the public sector market, our risks under these laws may increase. detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. in addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. if any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.   we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls. our platform is subject to u.s. export controls, including the u.s. export administration regulations, and we incorporate encryption technology into our platform. this encryption technology may be exported outside of the united states only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption classification request or self-classification report. obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, our activities are subject to u.s. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by various u.s. agencies, including the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control, that prohibit the sale or supply of most products and services to embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties. violations of u.s. sanctions or export control regulations can result in significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers. if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. also, various countries, in addition to the united states, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform in those countries. changes in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our platform globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. from time to time, various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, increased export and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations."
SNOW,"our international operations may subject us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. we are expanding our international operations to better support our growth into international markets. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency."
SNOW,"  changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. changes in tax laws, regulations, or rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. for example, 2017 legislation informally titled the tax act significantly reformed the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code). in august 2022, the united states passed the inflation reduction act, which provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. in february 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. we do not expect the excise tax on repurchases under our stock repurchase program to have a material impact on our aggregate tax liability. in addition, many countries have recently proposed, recommended, or enacted changes to existing tax laws or new tax laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. over the last several years, the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. as of july 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. as this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. similarly, the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (such as taxes based on a percentage of revenue or taxes applicable to digital services), which could apply to our business. due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. we continue to monitor the impact of new global and u.s. legislation on our effective tax rate."
SNOW,"our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. we have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. unused u.s. federal net operating losses (nols) for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused nols expire. under the tax act, as modified by 2020 legislation referred to as the cares act, u.s. federal nols arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such u.s. federal nols in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of such year’s taxable income. at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of nols is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. as of january 31, 2024, we had u.s. federal, state, and foreign nol carryforwards of $6.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $175.2 million, respectively. of the $6.2 billion u.s. federal nol carryforwards, $6.1 billion may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income, and the remaining $0.1 billion will begin to expire in 2032. the state nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2024. of the $175.2 million foreign nol carryforwards, $169.6 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining $5.6 million will begin to expire in 2027. in addition, under section 382 of the code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increasing their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change nol carryforwards to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. it is possible that we have experienced or may experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. this could limit the amount of nols that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. subsequent ownership changes and changes to the u.s. tax rules in respect of the utilization of nols may further affect the limitation in future years."
SNOW,"  changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined."
SNOW,"our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:  changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;  changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them;  changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;  the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and  the effects of acquisitions. any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations."
SNOW,"risks related to the ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline. the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:"
SNOW," actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;  variance in our actual or projected financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;  changes in the pricing or consumption of our platform;  updates to our projected operating and financial results;  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, investments, or new offerings;  rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  significant data breaches, disruptions to, or other incidents involving our platform;  our involvement in litigation;  changes in senior management or key personnel;  fluctuations in company valuations, particularly valuations of high-growth or cloud companies, perceived to be comparable to us;  the trading volume of our common stock;  changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market;  our issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock; and  general political, social, economic, and market conditions."
SNOW,"  broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. in addition, technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. we have been, and may be in the future, the target of this type of litigation, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management’s attention. we are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our ipo. see the section titled “legal proceedings” for more information."
SNOW,"future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. many of our stockholders who held our capital stock prior to completion of our ipo have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold based upon the price at which shares were sold in our ipo, and therefore, they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares. we are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plans, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will become eligible for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. further, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders. we expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. we expect to grant equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under our equity incentive plans. we may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. as part of our business strategy, we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline. we may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our stock repurchase program, and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price. in february 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. the program expires in march 2025. the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us, or our stock price. the existence of our stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any stock repurchase program."
SNOW,"  if securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, the market price or trading volume of our common stock could decline. the market price and trading volume of our common stock is heavily influenced by the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures. we do not have control over these analysts. if securities analysts or industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. if securities or industry analysts downgrade our common stock or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. further, investors and analysts may not understand how our consumption-based business model differs from a subscription-based business model. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, publish inaccurate research about our business, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock. we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the ability of the holders of our common stock to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. accordingly, holders of our common stock may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. we incur significant costs operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs. as a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. we are required, pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act (section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. this assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. our compliance with section 404 requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. we have established an internal audit group, and as we continue to grow, we will hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and update the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section 404.   during the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities. failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:  authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;"
SNOW," require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;  specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;  establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;  establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;  provide that our directors may only be removed for cause;  provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and  require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our common stock would receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in an acquisition."
SNOW,"  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the united states of america as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. this choice of forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.  furthermore, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such securities act actions. accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the united states of america will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act. while the delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. in such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. this may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. these choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business."

CRWD," if organizations do not adopt cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.  if we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services in response to rapid technological changes and market developments as well as evolving security threats, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.  if we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed.  if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products and add additional cloud modules to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed.  our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense,  we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  if our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to detect or prevent incidents or have or are perceived to have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation would be harmed, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.  as a cybersecurity provider, we have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. if our internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been breached, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected.  we rely on third-party data centers, such as amazon web services, and our own colocation data centers, to host and operate our falcon platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these facilities may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our falcon platform, which could cause our business to suffer.  we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business."
CRWD,"   if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.  claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.  if we are not able to comply with applicable data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific laws, regulations, standards or requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.  future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not manage our future growth, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. we have experienced rapid revenue growth in recent periods and we expect to continue to invest broadly across our organization to support our growth. for example, our headcount grew from 4,965 employees as of january 31, 2022, to 7,925 employees as of january 31, 2024. although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not sustain our current growth rates and our investments to support our growth may not be successful. the growth and expansion of our business will require us to invest significant financial and operational resources and the continuous dedication of our management team. our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage our growth effectively, which will require us to, among other things:"
CRWD," effectively attract, integrate, and retain a large number of new employees, particularly members of our sales and marketing and research and development teams;  further improve our falcon platform, including our cloud modules, and it infrastructure, including expanding and optimizing our data centers, to support our business needs;  enhance our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners and customers; and  improve our financial, management, and compliance systems and controls. if we fail to achieve these objectives effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of our falcon platform and key business systems, and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to our business could be impaired. additionally, the quality of our platform and services could suffer and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we have a history of losses, and while we have achieved profitability in quarterly periods, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. we have incurred net losses each year prior to fiscal 2024, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we experienced net gains of $89.3 million for fiscal 2024, and net losses of $183.2 million, and $234.8 million for fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. as of january 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion. while we have experienced significant growth in revenue in recent periods, and have achieved profitability during quarterly periods, we cannot assure you when or whether we will reach sustained profitability. we also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, which will negatively affect our results of operations if our total revenue does not increase. we cannot assure you that these investments will result in substantial increases in our total revenue or improvements in our results of operations. we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal,"
CRWD,"  accounting, and other expenses as a public company. any failure to increase our revenue as we invest in our business or to manage our costs could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow."
CRWD,"if organizations do not adopt cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions. the use of saas solutions to manage and automate security and it operations is at an early stage and rapidly evolving. as such, it is difficult to predict its potential growth, if any, customer adoption and retention rates, customer demand for our solutions, customer consolidation on our platform, or the success of existing competitive products. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our solutions and those of our competitors. if our solutions do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our solutions due to a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products, privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results. we do not know whether the trend in adoption of cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future. furthermore, if we or other saas security providers experience security incidents, loss or disclosure of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for saas solutions as a whole, including our security solutions, could be negatively affected. you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and evolving market. if we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services in response to rapid technological changes and market developments as well as evolving security threats, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed. our ability to increase revenue from existing customers and attract new customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to rapid technological changes and market developments as well as evolving security threats. the success of our falcon platform depends on our ability to take such changes into account and invest effectively in our research and development organization to increase the reliability, availability and scalability of our existing solutions and introduce new solutions. if we fail to effectively anticipate, identify or respond to such changes in a timely manner, or at all, our business could be harmed. even if we adequately fund our research and development efforts there is no guarantee that we will realize a return on such efforts. success in delivering enhancements and new solutions depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or new solution, the risk that such enhancement or new solution may have quality or other defects or deficiencies, especially in the early stages of introduction, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate sales capabilities in new markets. failure to effectively deliver, integrate, and manage perceptions with respect to enhancements and new solutions may erode our competitive position, significantly impair our revenue growth, and negatively impact our operating results. if we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed. to expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our falcon platform. our sales efforts often involve educating our prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our falcon platform. enterprises and governments that use legacy security products, such as signature-based or malware-based products, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and antivirus, for their it security may be hesitant to purchase our falcon platform if they believe that these products are more cost effective, provide substantially the same functionality as our falcon platform or provide a level of it security that is sufficient to meet their needs. we may have difficulty convincing prospective customers of the value of adopting our solution. even if we are successful in convincing prospective customers that a cloud native platform like ours is critical to protect against cyberattacks, they may not decide to purchase our falcon platform for a variety of reasons, some of which are out of our control. for example, any deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the geopolitical environment, the outbreak of diseases or other public health crises, volatility in the banking and financial services sector, or inflation (as well as government policies such as raising interest rates in response to inflation), have in the past and may in the future cause our current and prospective customers to delay or cut their overall security and it operations spending, and such delays or cuts may fall disproportionately on cloud-based security solutions like ours. economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on security and it operations may result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, an increase in multi-phase subscription start dates, shorter terms for customer subscriptions,"
CRWD,"  lengthened sales cycles, increased churn, lower demand for our products, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. furthermore, we may need to exercise more flexibility in customer payment terms as customers navigate a more challenging economic environment. additionally, if the incidence of cyberattacks were to decline, or be perceived to decline, or if organizations adopt endpoints that use operating systems we do not adequately support, our ability to attract new customers and expand sales of our solutions to existing customers could be adversely affected. if organizations do not continue to adopt our falcon platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products and add additional cloud modules to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed. in order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our falcon platform when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers by selling additional cloud modules and by deploying to more endpoints in their environments. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our falcon platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one year, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, customers that previously signed multi-year subscription contracts may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths, and customers may cease using certain cloud modules altogether. even if customers choose to renew their subscription of certain cloud modules, they may decline to purchase additional cloud modules or choose not to consolidate onto our falcon platform. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solutions, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition and general economic and geopolitical conditions. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may materially suffer."
CRWD,"our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our falcon platform. customers often view the subscription to our falcon platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our falcon platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens and adds uncertainty to our sales cycle. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may lead to additional scrutiny of budgets by current and prospective customers, which has resulted in, for example, longer sales cycles for products and services, and may result in shifting demand for it products and services, and slower adoption of new technologies. our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the market for security and it operations solutions is intensely competitive, fragmented, and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and by frequent introductions of new or improved products or services to combat security threats. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:  product capabilities, including performance and reliability, of our falcon platform, including our cloud modules, services, and features compared to those of our competitors;"
CRWD,"   our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to improve existing products, services, and features, or to develop new ones to address evolving customer needs;  our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees;  our ability to establish and maintain relationships with channel partners;  the strength of our sales and marketing efforts; and  acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors. our competitors include the following by general category:  legacy antivirus product providers who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional signature-based anti-virus protection;  alternative endpoint security providers who generally offer a mix of on-premise and cloud-hosted products that rely heavily on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques;  network security vendors who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint or cloud security solutions;   cloud security vendors, including those who focus on public cloud infrastructure and services;  identify security vendors that seek to identify and secure user accounts and related activities; and  professional service providers who offer cybersecurity response services. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do. further, they may have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, the provision of customer support, and the pursuit of acquisitions. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings as well as routes to market, which allows them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including our cloud modules. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, including with respect to ai. our competitors may more successfully incorporate ai into their products, gain or leverage superior access to certain ai technologies, and achieve higher market acceptance of their ai solutions. conditions in our market could also change rapidly and significantly due to partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. further, competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market quicker than we can or convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs. even if there is significant demand for cloud-based security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other security and it operations providers is more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding products from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.   competitive pricing pressure may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results. if we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures or other factors, our margins will be reduced and our gross profits, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. the subscription prices for our falcon platform, cloud modules, and professional services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions by our competitors, or promotional programs offered by us or our competitors. the cybersecurity market remains very competitive, and competition may further increase in the future. competitors may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. if our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to detect or prevent incidents or have or are perceived to have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation would be harmed, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our falcon platform and cloud modules, the failure of our platform to detect or prevent incidents, including advanced and newly developed attacks, misconfiguration of our solutions, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our platform could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. because our cloud native security platform is complex, it may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. we cannot assure you that our products will detect all cyberattacks, especially in light of the rapidly changing security threat landscape that our solution seeks to address. due to a variety of both internal and external factors, including, without limitation, defects or misconfigurations of our or third-party solutions, our solutions could be or become vulnerable to security incidents (both from intentional attacks and accidental causes) that cause them to fail to secure endpoints and detect and block attacks. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and endpoints change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are affected. additionally, our falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist, which may lessen customers’ trust in our solutions. moreover, as our cloud native security platform is adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, individuals and organizations behind advanced cyberattacks may intensify their efforts to defeat our security platform. if this happens, our systems and subscription customers could be specifically targeted by attackers and could result in vulnerabilities in our platform or undermine the market acceptance of our falcon platform and could adversely affect our reputation as a provider of security solutions. because we host customer data on our cloud platform, which in some cases may contain personally-identifiable information or potentially confidential information, a security compromise, or an accidental or intentional misconfiguration or malfunction of our platform or third-party platforms could result in personally-identifiable information and other customer data being accessible such as to attackers or to other customers. further, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next-generation or cloud-based security system, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and cloud-based security solutions such as ours in particular. organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks, systems, and endpoints. no security solution, including our falcon platform, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. if any of our customers experiences a successful cyberattack while using our solutions or services, such customer could be disappointed with our falcon platform, regardless of whether our solutions or services blocked the theft of any of such customer’s data, if the customer failed to protect its own credentials, or if the attack would have otherwise been mitigated or prevented if the customer had fully deployed aspects of our falcon platform. similarly, if our solutions detect attacks against a customer but the customer does not address the vulnerability, customers and the public may erroneously believe that our solutions were not effective. security breaches against customers that use our solutions may result in customers and the public believing that our solutions failed. our falcon platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our falcon platform to reflect the increasing sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. real or perceived security breaches of our customers’ networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, and other customer relations issues, and may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.   as a cybersecurity provider, we have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. if our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected. as a provider of security solutions, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities or to exploit our falcon platform as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. in particular, because we have been involved in the identification of organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we have been the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our systems. such efforts may also intensify as geopolitical tensions increase. we are also susceptible to inadvertent compromises of our systems and data, including those arising from process, coding, or human errors. moreover, we utilize third-party service providers to, among other things, host, transmit, or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain, operations, and communications. our third-party service providers and other vendors have faced and may continue to face cyberattacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents from a variety of sources. a successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service or that compromises our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property. we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such attacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data, or that of our third-party service providers and vendors. organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently. furthermore, employee error or malicious activity could compromise our systems. as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property including access to our source code, and information about vulnerabilities in our product, which in turn, could reduce the effectiveness of our solutions, or lead to cyberattacks or other intrusions of our customers’ networks, litigation, governmental audits and investigations and significant legal fees, any or all of which could damage our relationships with our existing customers and could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers. we have expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant resources in an effort to prevent security breaches and other security incidents impacting our systems and data. since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual or perceived security incident affecting our internal systems or data or data of our customers would be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution, and our business. in addition, while we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on third-party data centers, such as amazon web services, and our own colocation data centers to host and operate our falcon platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these facilities may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our falcon platform which could cause our business to suffer. our customers depend on the continuous availability of our falcon platform. we currently host our falcon platform and serve our customers using a mix of third-party data centers, primarily amazon web services, inc., or aws, and our data centers, hosted in colocation facilities. consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. we have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints.   the following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery, availability, and the performance of our falcon platform:  the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet;  the performance and availability of third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services, such as aws, with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services;  decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties;"
CRWD," physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events;  cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, or the infrastructure of the internet;  failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our data capacity requirements;  errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including third-party software incorporated in our software;  improper deployment or configuration of our solutions;  the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; and  the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. the adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. interruptions or failures in our service delivery could result in a cyberattack or other security threat to one of our customers during such periods of interruption or failure. additionally, interruptions or failures in our service could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, adversely affect our renewal rates, and harm our ability to attract new customers. our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that a cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solution is unreliable. while we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors. the occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to rapidly and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of george kurtz, our president and chief executive officer, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. we rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, research and development, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, our employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an “at-will” basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. in particular, they can cause operational and administrative inefficiencies, and could impact relationships with key customers and vendors. if mr. kurtz, or one or more of our key employees, or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business could be harmed."
CRWD,"  if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed. there is also significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology, cyber, sales, professional services, and administrative support functions. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications and security software. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. additionally, our incident response and proactive services team is small and comprised of personnel with highly technical skills and experience, who are in high demand, and who would be difficult to replace. more generally, the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. also, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards, which may give them a substantial amount of personal wealth. this may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected. we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel, particularly in international markets. we have expanded our sales organization significantly in recent periods and expect to continue to add additional sales capabilities in the near term. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and this delay is accentuated by our long sales cycles. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. in addition, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations. our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:"
CRWD," our ability to attract new and retain existing customers;  the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers;  economic difficulties confronting our customers, which may impact the number of modules or endpoint deployments they are willing or able to purchase;  insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions;  the timing and length of our sales cycles;  changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs;  any disruption in our relationship with channel partners;  changes in the growth rate of the cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions market;  the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors;  decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our falcon platform;  significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our falcon platform;  negative media coverage or publicity;  our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;  the amount and timing of operating costs (including new hires), tightening of labor markets and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business;   extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes;  increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;  future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices;"
CRWD,"   deteriorating or volatile conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including as a result of weak or negative gross domestic product growth, uncertainty or disruptions in the capital and credit markets, changing interest rates, inflation, bank failures or adverse conditions impacting financial institutions, and supply-chain disruptions; and"
CRWD," political events, geopolitical unrest or tension, acts of war and terrorism. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the year due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. in addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, typically with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year. any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and technology alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our crowdstrike and falcon brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our falcon platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our falcon platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry or financial analysts and research firms often test our solutions and provide reviews of our falcon platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our falcon platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. additionally, the performance of our channel partners and technology alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile private and public customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks, which sometimes involve nation-state actors. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. changing political environments in the united states and abroad may amplify the media and political scrutiny we face. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our falcon platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our falcon platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed. in addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our channel partners to sell and support our falcon platform. the vast majority of sales of our falcon platform flow through our channel partners, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or technology alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our falcon platform. if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our solutions, or if we are unable to enter into"
CRWD,"  arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of, high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell solutions and keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and results of operations will be harmed."
CRWD,"our international operations and plans for future international expansion expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely impact our business. we derived approximately 32%, 30%, and 28% of our total revenue from our international customers for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. we expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. these international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including:  greater difficulty in negotiating contracts with standard terms, enforcing contracts and managing collections, and longer collection periods;  higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;  management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;  risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification, and localization of our falcon platform that may be required in foreign countries;  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;  compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, or fcpa, the u.s. travel act and the u.k. bribery act 2010, or bribery act, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties, and collateral consequences for our company;  heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;  the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets;  foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the united states;  political and economic instability in some countries;  double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the united states or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;  unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements (including, but not limited to data localization requirements);  requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;"
CRWD,"   greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;  greater difficulty identifying qualified channel partners and maintaining successful relationships with such partners;  differing employment practices and labor relations issues; and  difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations. additionally, nearly all of our sales contracts are currently denominated in u.s. dollars. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our international customers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states; is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the australian dollar, british pound, canadian dollar, euro, indian rupee, and japanese yen; and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. as we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, subject to budgetary uncertainty and typically involves long sales cycles. we have made significant investment to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. u.s. federal, state and local government sales as well as foreign government sales are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business."
CRWD,"sales to such government entities include, but are not limited to, the following risks:  selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;  we may be required to obtain personnel security clearances and facility clearances to perform on classified contracts for government agencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain such clearances;  government certification, software supply chain, or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our products are constantly evolving and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell to certain government customers until we have attained the new or revised certification or meet other applicable requirements, which we are not guaranteed to do. for example, although we are currently certified under the u.s. federal risk and authorization management program, or fedramp, such certification is costly to maintain and if we lose our certification it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers;  government product requirements are often technically complex and assessors may require us to make costly changes to our products to meet such requirements without any assurance that such changes will generate a sale;"
CRWD,"   government demand and payment for our falcon platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays in the government appropriations or procurement processes adversely affecting public sector demand for our falcon platform, including as a result of abrupt events such as war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics;  government attitudes towards us as a company, our platform or the capabilities that we offer as a viable software solution may change, and reduce interest in our products and services as acceptable solutions;  changes in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, can create uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and reduce available funding for our products and services;  third parties may compete intensely with us on pending, new or existing contracts with government products, which can also lead to appeals, disputes, or litigation relating to government procurement, including but not limited to bid protests by unsuccessful bidders on potential or actual awards of contracts to us or our partners by the government;"
CRWD," even if we are awarded a sale, the terms of such contracts may be unusually burdensome;  governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our falcon platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities; and  governments may require certain products to be manufactured, hosted, or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies. the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grow. as our customers gain more experience with our solutions, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our platform and services are being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed."
CRWD,"  additionally, we have and will continue to make substantial investments to support growth at our data centers and improve the profitability of our cloud platform. for example, because of the importance of aws’ services to our business and aws’ position in the cloud-based server industry, any renegotiation or renewal of our agreement with aws may be on terms that are significantly less favorable to us than our current agreement. if our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with aws are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our falcon platform and in our ability to make our solutions available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits. in addition, we may be required to re-invest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers. we may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results."
CRWD,"our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support. once our falcon platform is deployed within our customers’ networks, our customers depend on our customer support services to resolve any issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our falcon platform. if we do not provide effective ongoing support, customer renewals and our ability to sell additional modules as part of our falcon platform to existing customers could be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. many larger organizations have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller customers and we offer premium services for these customers. failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new solutions, which capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and which could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. retaining or expanding our current levels of personnel and product and service offerings may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or services and enhancements to our falcon platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products or services could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our class a common stock could decline. if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of our class a common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that further restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders. any of the above could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. we believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on building and marketing our falcon platform. as we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. additionally, our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. if we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our falcon platform, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
CRWD,"  we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform. supply chain disruptions could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network, replace defective equipment in our existing data centers and impact our operating costs. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform and provide services to our customers. we generally purchase these components on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over production costs and constraints based on the then current availability, terms and pricing of these components. if we experience disruption or delay from our suppliers, we may not be able to obtain supplies or components from alternative suppliers on a timely basis or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. the technology industry has experienced widespread component shortages and delivery delays, including as a result of geopolitical tensions, public health crises and natural disasters. while we have taken steps to mitigate our supply chain risk, supply chain disruptions and delays could nevertheless adversely impact our operations by, among other things, causing us to delay opening new data centers, delay increasing capacity or replacing defective equipment at existing data centers, and experience increased operating costs.  risks related to intellectual property, legal, and regulatory matters the success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. we believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and abroad, all of which provide only limited protection. the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable. moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. we have filed for patents in the united states and in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. for example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and even if we do detect violations, litigation or technical changes to our products may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the united states. any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, which could harm our business and results of operations. further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. the inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents.   claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business. a number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. as we face increasing competition and grow, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us also grows. in addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. from time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. as the number of products and competitors in the security and it operations market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. while we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. in addition, future litigation may involve non-practicing entities, companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, even a claim without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. additionally, our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims that may be made. in the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. if we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features while developing such technology. although third parties may offer a license to their technology or other intellectual property, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. in addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. if a third party does not offer us a license to its technology or other intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we could be enjoined from continued use of such intellectual property. as a result, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services, while developing such technology. furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services. any such judgment or settlement could also require us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations."
CRWD,"we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business. we currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. we cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our falcon platform. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower"
CRWD,"  quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. as a result, our margins, market share, and results of operations could be significantly harmed. we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.  we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. ensuring compliance with such requirements may increase operating costs, impact our data processing practices and policies and the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. in the united states, there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and data disposal laws. for example, at the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission (which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security), as well as the electronic communication privacy act, the computer fraud and abuse act, the health insurance portability and accountability act, and the gramm leach bliley act. the united states congress also has considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, various proposals for comprehensive federal data privacy and security legislation, to which we may become subject if passed. at the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act (collectively, the “ccpa”). the ccpa broadly defines personal information and gives california residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. the ccpa provides for severe civil penalties and statutory damages for violations and a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of unencrypted personal information. this private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. numerous other states have also enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations that share similarities with the ccpa. moreover, laws in all 50 u.s. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data privacy and security legal framework with which we must comply. for example, we are required to comply with the european union (“eu”) general data protection regulation (“gdpr”) and its equivalent in the u.k. (“u.k. gdpr”), which impose stringent obligations regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data. while the gdpr and u.k. gdpr remain substantially similar for the time being, the u.k. government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the gdpr. while these developments increase uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the u.k., even in their current, substantially similar form, the gdpr and u.k. gdpr can expose businesses to divergent parallel regimes that may be subject to potentially different interpretations and enforcement actions for certain violations and related uncertainty. failure to comply with the gdpr or the u.k. gdpr can result in significant fines and other liability, including, under the gdpr, fines of up to eur 20 million (or gbp 17.5 million under the u.k. gdpr) or four percent (4%) of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. european data protection authorities have already imposed fines for gdpr violations of up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of euros. legal developments in the european economic area (“eea”) have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states and other so-called third countries outside the eea, including in the context of website cookies. similar complexities and uncertainties also apply to transfers from the u.k. to third countries. while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses (“sccs”) and the u.k.’s international data transfer agreement (or the u.k.’s international data transfer addendum that can be used with the sccs), the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain. on july 10, 2023, the european commission adopted an adequacy decision concluding that the u.s. ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the eu to the u.s. under the recently adopted eu-u.s. data privacy framework (followed on october 12, 2023 with the adoption of an adequacy decision in the u.k. for the u.k.-u.s. data bridge); however, such new    adequacy decision has been challenged in eu courts, and is likely to face additional challenges. moreover, although the u.k. currently has an adequacy decision from the european commission, such that sccs are not required for the transfer of personal data from the eea to the u.k., that decision will sunset in june 2025 unless extended and it may be revoked in the future by the european commission if the u.k. data protection regime is reformed in ways that deviate substantially from the gdpr. the eu has also proposed legislation that would regulate non-personal data and establish new cybersecurity standards, and other countries, including the u.k., may similarly do so in the future. if we are otherwise unable to transfer data, including personal data, between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. while we have implemented new controls and procedures designed to comply with the requirements of the gdpr, u.k. gdpr and the data privacy and security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data. moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. if our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information, whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the federal trade commission or applicable state attorneys general.  our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). there also has been increased regulatory scrutiny from the sec with respect to adequately disclosing risks concerning cybersecurity and data privacy. such scrutiny from the sec increases the risk of investigations into the cybersecurity practices, and related disclosures, of companies within its jurisdiction. any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or negatively impact our ability to contract with customers, including those in the public sector. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing data protection, data privacy and data security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states. increased scrutiny of technologies like ai may also become subject to regulation under new laws or new applications of existing laws, such as the ai act being considered in the eu. noncompliance by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:"
CRWD," investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions;  mandatory changes to our falcon platform;  disgorgement of profits, fines and damages;  civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;  claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;"
CRWD,"   termination of contracts;  loss of intellectual property rights;   loss of our license to do business in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and  temporary or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we endeavor to properly classify employees as exempt versus non-exempt under applicable law. although there are no pending or threatened material claims or investigations against us asserting that some employees are improperly classified as exempt, the possibility exists that some of our current or former employees could have been incorrectly classified as exempt employees. these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with customers, including those in the public sector, could result in reduced sales of our products or services, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business, reputation, and results of operations. we are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our products, services and business activities, including our collection of information about cyber threats, are subject to various restrictions under u.s. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the u.s. commerce department’s export administration regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control. the u.s. export control laws and u.s. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or service or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our service in those countries. changes in our products or services or changes in these laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products or services into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or services globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products or services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our products or services or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products or services in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and monetary penalties. although we take precautions to prevent our products or services from being provided in violation of such laws, our products or services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. this could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and harm to our reputation.   we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (“fcpa”), the u.k. bribery act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. as we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. in addition, we use channel partners, agents and other third-parties to sell our products or conduct business on our behalf. we or such third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and under certain circumstances we could be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of such partners, and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. we have implemented an anti-corruption compliance program but cannot ensure that all our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. noncompliance with the fcpa, other applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to investigations, whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, and other enforcement actions within the u.s. and internationally. any violation of these laws could result in disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts and other consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition."
CRWD,"some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our falcon platform and subject us to possible litigation. our products and subscriptions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our falcon platform, and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims could result in litigation. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, discovering certain open source software code in our falcon platform, or a finding that we have breached the terms of an open source software license, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, by, among other things:"
CRWD,"   resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation;  diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business;  requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;  causing delays in the deployment of our falcon platform or service offerings to our customers;  requiring us to stop offering certain services or features of our falcon platform;  requiring us to redesign certain components of our falcon platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense;  requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and  requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. we utilize artificial intelligence, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business. we incorporate novel uses of ai technologies, including generative ai, into our products and operations. ai is complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. the introduction of ai into new or existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. for example, if we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content on which our ai technologies rely, we may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party. ai algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable. our customers or others may rely on or use this flawed content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. the use of ai presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. the technologies underlying ai and its uses are subject to a variety of laws, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws. ai is the subject of ongoing review by various u.s. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various u.s. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their cybersecurity and data protection laws to ai or are considering general legal frameworks for ai, such as the ai act currently being considered in the eu. as a fast-evolving and complicated technology subject to significant government attention, ai-related legislation and regulation may be developed and apply to ai in unexpected ways. we may not be able to anticipate how to respond to or comply with these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. furthermore, because ai technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of ai. we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer. certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our falcon platform. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our falcon platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our falcon platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheets for such commitments. our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers.   we are currently, and may in the future become, involved in litigation that may adversely affect us. we are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations and other proceedings including patent, product liability, class action, whistleblower, personal injury, property damage, labor and employment (including allegations of wage and hour violations), commercial disputes, compliance with laws and regulatory requirements and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings as our business develops. such claims, suits, and government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition, and/or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products may harm our business and results of operations. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, these provisions do not cover our indemnification obligations and they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. the sale and support of our products also entails the risk of product liability claims. additionally, our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims regarding intellectual property infringement, breach of agreement, including confidentiality, privacy and security obligations, violation of applicable laws, damages caused by failures of our solutions or to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products and services, or other acts or omissions. these contractual provisions often survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. we have not to date received any indemnification claims from third parties. however, as we continue to grow, the possibility of these claims against us will increase. if our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees, and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our products and services, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or other claims, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. additionally, our falcon platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. for example, our falcon platform might be misused by a customer to monitor its employee’s activities in a manner that violates the employee’s privacy rights under applicable law. during the course of performing certain solution-related services and our professional services, our teams may have significant access to our customers’ networks. we cannot be sure that an employee may not take advantage of such access which may make our customers vulnerable to malicious activity by such employee. any such misuse of our falcon platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and results of operations.   we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we offer our falcon complete customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. while we maintain insurance relating to our warranty, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover such claims, that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any claim. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have paid the warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering this warranty which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment. we cannot predict the prices at which our class a common stock will trade. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
CRWD," actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;  the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;  industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec;  rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;  failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;  litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;  developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;  announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;  any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to mr. kurtz;"
CRWD,"   effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics;  general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and  other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our class a common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock in the public market, including shares of class a stock that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. as of february 29, 2024, we had 229,383,465 shares of class a common stock outstanding and 12,485,193 shares of class b common stock outstanding. in addition, certain holders of our class b common stock are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the securities act pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement. if these holders of our class b common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our class a common stock. we may also issue our shares of class a common stock or securities convertible into shares of our class a common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our class a common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. in addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to the completion of our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. our class b common stock has 10 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors and the approval of any change in control transaction. future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in    those shares converting to class a common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. as of january 31, 2024, our executive officers, directors, one of our current stockholders and its respective affiliates held, in aggregate, 36% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control or other liquidity event of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale or other liquidity event and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply to accel, or its respective affiliates, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of our credit facility. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. certain provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management, and may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. these provisions include:  our dual class common stock structure, which provides our holders of class b common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock;  a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;  the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, which prohibition will take effect on the first date on which the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock represents less than 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock and our class b common stock, taken together as a single class;    the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;"
CRWD," certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock; and  advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. these provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware, and to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the united states, will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for:  any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;  any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;  any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and  any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine. however, this exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act. in addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the united states will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the state of delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. as of january 31, 2024, we had $750.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (excluding intercompany indebtedness), and there is additional availability under our revolving facility of up to $750.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;"
CRWD,"   requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;"
CRWD," increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; and  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving facility, are at variable rates of interest; and increasing our cost of borrowing. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the senior notes, depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. the terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the senior notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. in addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. in the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. further, our credit agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our revolving facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. if we breach the covenants under our debt instruments, we would be in default under such instruments. the holders of such indebtedness could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain terms which restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:  incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;  prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness;  sell or otherwise dispose of assets;  incur liens;"
CRWD,"   enter into transactions with affiliates;  alter the businesses we conduct;  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and  consolidate, merge with, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. the covenants in the indenture and supplemental indenture that govern the senior notes are subject to exceptions and qualifications. in addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet them. these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to:"
CRWD," finance our operations;  make needed capital expenditures;  make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;  withstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;  engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and  plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. these restrictions may affect our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. a breach of the covenants under our revolving facility or the indenture that governs our senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. in addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving facility would permit the lenders under our revolving facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness."
CRWD,
CRWD,"general risk factors if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (“sarbanes-oxley act”), the rules and regulations of nasdaq, and other securities rules and regulations that impose various requirements on public companies. our management and other personnel devote substantial time and resources to comply with these rules and regulations. such compliance has increased, and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our consolidated financial statements and in the reports that we file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations, may result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could result in an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, and lead to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to, and issue an opinion on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our class a common stock to decline. any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our stock. future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services or technologies. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner in the future is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers or investors. in addition, our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or issues with employees or customers. if we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. we may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in    increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include:  diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;  coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions;  integration of administrative systems, employee, product and service offerings;  retention of key employees from the acquired company;  changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;  the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and

CRWD," additional legal, regulatory or compliance requirements;  financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we do not adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect;  liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and  litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations. we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business in international markets. we generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. we are subject to federal, state, and local income, sales, and other taxes in the united states and income, withholding, transaction, and other taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. in addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected, among other things, by (i) changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including increases in corporate tax rates and greater taxation of international income and changes relating to income tax nexus, (ii) recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory"
CRWD,"  rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, (iii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or (iv) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (“oecd”) has published proposals covering a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules, tax treaties, and taxation of the digital economy. on october 8, 2021, the oecd/g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting (the “inclusive framework”) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform originally agreed on july 1, 2021, and a timetable for implementation by 2023. the timetable for implementation has since been extended to 2024 and, with respect to certain components of the plan, to 2025. under pillar one, a portion of the residual profits of multinational businesses with global turnover above €20 billion and a profit margin above 10% will be allocated to market jurisdictions where such allocated profits would be taxed. under pillar two, the inclusive framework has agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million, calculated on a jurisdictional basis. while substantial work remains to be completed by the oecd and national governments on the implementation of these proposals, future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. on february 1, 2023, the u.s. financial accounting standards board (""fasb"") indicated that they believe the minimum tax imposed under pillar two is an alternative minimum tax, and, accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. in addition, the oecd’s proposed solution envisages new international tax rules and the removal of all digital services taxes (“dst”). notwithstanding this, some countries, in the european union and beyond, continue to operate existing dst regimes to capture tax revenue on digital services more immediately. such laws may increase our tax obligations in those countries or change the manner in which we operate our business."
CRWD,"our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate u.s. federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of $1.5 billion and $243.9 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for income tax purposes. the federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely, and california net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032. as of january 31, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards for other states of $0.8 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal 2025. as of january 31, 2024, we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of $113.9 million and $27.4 million, respectively. the federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036, and the california carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely. as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate united kingdom net operating loss carryforwards of $78.0 million and israel net operating loss carryforwards of $51.5 million, which are carried forward indefinitely. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset u.s. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.  taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts,"
CRWD,"  and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses; valuation of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants; carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets; loss contingencies; and the provision for income taxes and related deferred taxes. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we are subject to risks associated with our equity investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could adversely impact our financial results. through our falcon funds, we invest in early to late stage private companies, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize. these companies are often dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies in which we have invested could deteriorate, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies. in addition, our ability to realize gains on investments may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. for example, to the extent a company we have invested in undergoes an initial public offering, we may be subject to a lock-up agreement that restricts our ability to sell our securities for a period of time after the public offering or otherwise impedes our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities. further, valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. in addition, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our marketable equity investments, the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our non-marketable equity investments, and changes in the proportionate share of earnings and losses or impairment of our equity investments accounted for under the equity method. this volatility could be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline.   expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. there is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (“esg”) matters, both in the united states and internationally. we have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake certain esg-related initiatives, goals and commitments, which we have communicated on our website, in our sec filings and elsewhere. these initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. we could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our esg-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. in addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. stakeholders could also challenge the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of our esg-related disclosures. our actual or perceived failure to achieve some or all of our esg-related initiatives, goals, or commitments or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations or regulatory requirements could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers and expose us to increased scrutiny from esg-focused investors, regulatory authorities and others, or subject us to liability. damage to our reputation or reduced demand for our products may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. our business is subject to the risks of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, natural events such as earthquakes, fire, floods, and the outbreak of diseases, as well as man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses or data security breaches. our principal executive offices are located in austin, texas, and we also maintain other office locations around the world, including in california and india, that are prone to natural disasters including severe weather and seismic activity. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or significant power outage and other catastrophic events, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as covid-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as public health crises, could affect our personnel, recovery of our assets, data centers, supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters. if our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of ai, and our internal systems may be victimized by such attacks. although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster, or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses we may incur. all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, or delays in the rendering of our services, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected."

ZS,"risks related to our growth we have a history of annual net losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. we have incurred net losses in all annual periods since our inception, and we expect we will continue to incur annual net losses for the foreseeable future. we experienced net losses of $57.7 million, $202.3 million and $390.3 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. as of july 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,148.1 million. because the market for our cloud platform is rapidly evolving and cloud-based security solutions have not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we continue to hire additional personnel, particularly in research and development and sales and marketing, expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, and continue to develop our platform. if we fail to increase our revenue to offset the increases in our operating expenses, we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. additionally, our business strategy continues to focus primarily on long-term growth. as we execute on this strategy, we may ultimately be unable to achieve or sustain profitability at the level contemplated by industry or financial analysts and our stockholders, and as a result, our stock price may decline."
ZS,"if organizations do not adopt our cloud platform, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected. cloud security technologies are still evolving, and it remains difficult to predict customer demand and adoption rates for our solutions. we believe that our cloud platform offers superior protection to our customers, who are becoming increasingly dependent on the internet as they move their applications and data to the cloud. we also believe that our cloud platform represents a major shift from on-premises appliance-based security solutions. while cloud-based security solutions have seen increased adoption, traditional on-premises security appliances continue to be entrenched in the infrastructure of many of our potential customers, particularly large enterprises, because of their prior investment in and the familiarity of their it personnel with on-premises appliance-based solutions. as a result, our sales process often involves extensive efforts to educate our customers on the benefits and capabilities of our cloud platform, particularly as we continue to pursue customer relationships with large organizations. even with these efforts, we cannot predict long-term market acceptance of our cloud platform, or the adoption of competing products, services or technologies. if we fail to achieve broad market acceptance of our cloud platform or are unable to keep pace with industry changes, our ability to grow our business and our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. if we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed. to increase our revenue and achieve and maintain profitability, we must add new customers. to add new customers, we must successfully convince it decision makers that security delivered through our cloud platform provides significant advantages over legacy on-premises appliance-based security products and competing cloud-based products. additionally, many of our customers broadly deploy our products, which requires a significant commitment of resources from our customers. these factors significantly impact our ability to add new customers and increase the time, resources and sophistication required to do so."
ZS,"  in addition, numerous other factors, many of which are out of our control, have impacted and may in the future impact our ability to add new customers, including potential customers’ commitments to legacy it security vendors and products, real or perceived switching costs, competition from hybrid or cloud security products, our failure to expand, retain and motivate our sales and marketing personnel, our failure to develop or expand relationships with our channel partners or to attract new channel partners, failure by us or our partners to help our customers to successfully deploy our cloud platform, negative media or industry or financial analyst commentary regarding us or our solutions, or similar solutions offered by other vendors, litigation and general economic conditions. as a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we have experienced and may experience in the future increased scrutiny and a longer approval process for initial purchases by new customers, particularly for larger transactions. we cannot predict how long these challenging macroeconomic conditions will persist, and customer cautiousness could continue or worsen or result in potential customers deciding to forego our services entirely. if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline, we may not achieve profitability and our future results of operations could be materially harmed.  if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services and add additional users and services to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed. in order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our services when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically one to three years, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, in certain cases, customers may cancel their subscriptions without cause either at any time or upon advance written notice (commonly ranging from 30 days to 60 days), typically subject to an early termination penalty for unused services. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer users, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to a lower-cost product suite. if our customers do not renew their subscription services, we could incur impairment losses related to our deferred contract acquisition costs. it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention because of our varied customer base and given the length of our subscription contracts. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our prices and pricing plans, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of users to which our customers deploy our solutions, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, competition and deteriorating general economic conditions, which may result in reductions in it budgets and lower employee headcounts. our future success also depends in part on the rate at which our current customers add additional users or services to their subscriptions, which is driven by a number of factors, including customer satisfaction with our services, customer security and networking issues and requirements, general economic conditions and customer reaction to the price per additional user or of additional services. if our efforts to expand our relationship with our existing customers are not successful, our business may materially suffer."
ZS,"we have experienced rapid revenue and other growth in recent periods, which may not be indicative of our future performance.  we have experienced rapid growth in revenue, operations and employee headcount in recent periods. in addition, the number of customers, users and internet traffic on our cloud platform has increased rapidly in recent years. our growth may not be sustainable and may not be sufficient to achieve and sustain profitability, as we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we expand our operations and significantly increase our headcount. in addition, we expect our recent revenue growth rates will decline in the future as the size of our revenue base increases. as a result, we believe that historical comparisons of our revenue may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance."
ZS,"  accordingly, you should not rely on our revenue and other growth for any prior quarter or fiscal year as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. if we fail to effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, adequately address competitive challenges or maintain our corporate culture, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. our growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively, which will require that we continue to improve our administrative, operational, financial and management systems and controls by, among other things:"
ZS," effectively attracting, retaining, training and integrating, including collaborating with, a large number of new employees;   further improving our key business applications, processes and it infrastructure, including our data centers, to support our business needs;   enhancing our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners, customers and users; and   appropriately documenting and testing our it systems and business processes.  these and other improvements in our systems and controls will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management and employee resources. if we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of our cloud platform and key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies could be impaired, the quality of our platform and services could suffer and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. in addition, we believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork and an emphasis on customer-focused results. we also believe that our culture creates an environment that drives and perpetuates our strategy and cost-effective distribution approach. in the past we have, and in the future we may, restructure or reduce our workforce to align people, roles and projects to our strategic priorities. any restructuring, reduction or realignment in the workforce has the potential to negatively impact employee morale or make it more difficult to attract and retain talent. as we continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. preservation of our corporate culture is also made more difficult following the implementation of our hybrid work environment, and many of our employees continue to work from home on a full time or part time basis. any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. if we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could materially impair our ability to attract new customers, support and retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:"
ZS,"   broad market acceptance and the level of demand for our cloud platform;   our ability to attract new customers, particularly large enterprises;   our ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our platform, particularly our largest customers;   our ability to successfully expand internationally and penetrate key markets;   the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;   the length of our sales cycle;  the timing and availability of renewals;   technological changes and the timing and success of new service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market;"
ZS," increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;   pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise;   seasonal buying patterns for it spending, including the possible slowdown in it spending due to the recent global economic downturn;   the quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan;   reputational harm as a result of actual, perceived or purported technological failure or disruption;  adverse litigation judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs;   changes in the legislative or regulatory environment;   the impact and costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property rights;   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;  changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles; and   general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, including as a result of geopolitical uncertainty and instability (such as the current conflicts between russia and ukraine and in the middle east), global health crises and pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, and governmental responses thereto.  any one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. we also intend to continue to invest significantly to grow our business in the near future rather than optimizing for profitability or cash flows. in addition, we generally experience seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. we typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the second half of our fiscal year. this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription, which is generally one to three years. we expect that seasonality will continue to affect our operating results in the future and may reduce our ability to predict cash flow and optimize the timing of our operating expenses. the variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of industry or financial analysts. if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for"
ZS,"  these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits."
ZS,"our business and growth depend in part on the success of our relationships with our channel partners.  we currently derive most of our revenue from sales through our channel partner network, and we expect for the foreseeable future most of our future revenue growth will also be driven through this network. not only does our joint sales approach require additional investment to grow and train our sales force, but we believe that continued growth in our business is dependent upon identifying, developing and maintaining strategic relationships with our existing and potential channel partners, including global systems integrators and regional telecommunications service providers that will in turn drive substantial revenue and provide additional value-added services to our customers. our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with our cloud platform. our channel partners may also cease marketing or reselling our platform with limited or no notice and without penalty. if our channel partners do not effectively market and sell subscriptions to our cloud platform, choose to promote our competitors’ products or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell subscriptions to our cloud platform may be adversely affected. for example, sales through our top five channel partners and their affiliates, in aggregate, represented 25% of our revenue for fiscal 2024, 26% of our revenue for fiscal 2023 and 28% of our revenue for fiscal 2022. in addition, our channel partner structure could subject us to lawsuits or reputational harm if, for example, a channel partner misrepresents the functionality of our cloud platform to customers or violates applicable laws or our corporate policies. moreover, our channel partners' operations may be negatively impacted by events including pandemics, international conflicts, inflation and other events affecting the global economy in general. for example, these events could increase credit risk of end customers and create uncertainty in credit markets. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners, identifying additional channel partners and training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform. if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our existing channel partners or develop successful relationships with new channel partners or if our channel partners fail to perform, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected."
ZS,"risks related to our products and services we face intense and increasing competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the market for network security solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services and improvements of existing products and services. our business model of delivering security through the cloud rather than legacy on-premises appliances, while gaining increasing support, has not yet achieved widespread market adoption. moreover, we compete with many established network and security vendors who are aggressively competing against us with their legacy appliance-based solutions and have also introduced cloud-based services that purport to have functionality similar to our cloud platform. we are experiencing increased competition as other established and emerging companies enter the cloud-based security solutions market and introduce new products, services and technologies to address evolving customer requirements. if we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or our growth rate that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations."

ZS,"   large networking and other vendors, which offer security appliances and/or incorporate security capabilities in their networking products and other services;  companies with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, casb, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and vpn; and   other providers of it security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform."
ZS,"many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:  greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger customer bases;   larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;   broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and customers;   greater customer support resources;   greater resources to make acquisitions and enter into strategic partnerships;   lower labor and research and development costs;   larger and more mature intellectual property rights portfolios; and   substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.  our competitors may be successful in convincing it decision makers that legacy appliance-based security products or hybrid security cloud solutions based on legacy technology are sufficient to meet their security needs and provide security performance that competes with our cloud platform. in addition, our competitors have and may develop cloud-based solutions with architectures similar to our products. further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based networks and have established deep relationships with appliance vendors. as a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings, which may allow them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering free services and other concessions, bundling products or maintaining closed technology platforms. many competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market more quickly than we can or to convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs. conditions in our market change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may introduce similar or superior products, services and technologies that compete with our cloud platform. in addition, large companies with substantial communications infrastructure, such as global telecommunications services provider partners or public cloud providers, have entered or could choose to enter the security solutions market. some of our current or potential competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs."
ZS,"  these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. any failure to meet and address these factors could materially harm our business and operating results."
ZS,"if the delivery of our services to our customers is interrupted or delayed for any reason, our business would suffer. any interruption or delay in the delivery of our services will negatively impact our customers. our solutions enable secure connections to cloud-based applications and other destinations via the internet, by directing our customers’ internet traffic through our cloud platform. our customers depend on the continuous availability of our cloud platform to access the internet, and our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. however, our platform is complex and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. if we fail to timely detect defects or errors before deployment, or if our entire platform were to fail, customers and users could lose access to critical services and applications until such disruption is resolved or customers deploy our disaster recovery solution that allows them to bypass our cloud platform to access the internet. the adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers expect continuous and uninterrupted internet access and have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. while we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors. the following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery and availability of our services and the performance of our cloud:  the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet;   the performance and availability of third-party telecommunications services with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services;   decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed or by global telecommunications service provider partners who provide us with network bandwidth to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties;   the occurrence of earthquakes, floods, fires, pandemics, power loss, system failures, physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war, international conflicts (such as the current conflicts between russia and ukraine and in the middle east) or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events;   cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, our global telecommunications service provider partners or the infrastructure of the internet;   government action to limit access to the internet;  failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our traffic capacity requirements;   errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including those potentially introduced by our software updates and third-party software incorporated in our software, which we use to operate our cloud platform;   improper classification of websites by our vendors who provide us with lists of malicious websites;   improper deployment or configuration of our services by our customers;"
ZS,"   the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; and"
ZS," the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements.  the occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively impact our relationship with our customers or otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we provide our services through a cloud-based inline proxy, and some governments, third-party products, websites or services may block proxy-based traffic under certain circumstances. for example, vendors may attempt to block traffic from our cloud platform or blacklist our ip addresses because they cannot identify the source of the proxy-based traffic. our competitors may use this as an excuse to block traffic from their solutions or blacklist our ip addresses, which may result in our customers’ traffic being blocked from our platform. if our customers experience significant instances of traffic blockages, they will experience reduced functionality or other inefficiencies, which would reduce customer satisfaction with our services and likelihood of renewal. if we fail to develop or introduce new enhancements to our cloud platform on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers, remain competitive and grow our business could be impaired. the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and services, evolving industry standards and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis and continue to introduce enhancements to our cloud platform. for example, advancements in technology, such as ai and ml, are changing the way our industry identifies and responds to cyber threats, and businesses that are slow to adopt or fail to adopt these new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. the success of our cloud platform depends on our continued investment in our research and development organization to increase the reliability, availability and scalability of our existing solutions. the success of any enhancement depends on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhancement. any new service that we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. if new technologies emerge that deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, these technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively. any delay or failure in the introduction of enhancements could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. if our global network of data centers, which deliver our services, was damaged or otherwise failed to meet the requirements of our business, our ability to provide services to our customers and maintain the performance of our cloud platform could be negatively impacted, which could cause our business to suffer. we currently host our cloud platform and serve our customers from a global network of over 160 data centers. while we have electronic access to the components and infrastructure of our cloud platform that are hosted by third parties, we do not control the operation of these facilities. consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as a lack of adequate support for our data center operations due to reasons that are outside of our direct control. our data centers are vulnerable to damage and connections to our data centers may be interrupted by a variety of sources, including earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, system or infrastructure failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events, including those exacerbated by the effects of climate change. our data centers may also be subject to national or local administrative actions, changes in government regulations, including, for example, the impact of global economic and other sanctions like those levied in response to the current conflict between russia and ukraine, changes to legal or permitting requirements and"
ZS,"  litigation to stop, limit or delay operations. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in interruptions or delays in our services, impede our ability to scale our operations or have other adverse impacts upon our business. in addition, if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements or experience significant strains on our data center capacity, we may experience delays and additional expenses in arranging new data centers, and our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and materially harm our business. for example, to manage a dramatic increase in zpa traffic resulting from our customers' employees working from home at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic, we temporarily increased our use of public cloud infrastructure, which is substantially more expensive than our own data centers. if we must again materially increase our use of public cloud infrastructure in the future, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.  if our cloud platform or internal networks, systems or data are or are perceived to have been breached, our solution may be perceived as insecure, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively impacted. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate the risk of breaches of our cloud platform or other security incidents affecting our cloud platform or our internal systems, networks or data. in addition, the functionality of our platform may be disrupted, either intentionally or due to negligence, by third parties, including disgruntled employees or contractors and other current or former employees or contractors. the security measures we use internally and have integrated into our cloud platform, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to identify or protect against certain attacks. enterprises are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. the growth in state sponsored cyber activity, including those actions taken in connection with the current conflict between russia and ukraine, showcase the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an electronic intrusion into our customers through our cloud platform or to prevent breaches and other security incidents affecting our cloud platform, internal networks, systems or data. further, once identified, we may be unable to remediate or otherwise respond to a breach or other incident in a timely manner. actual, perceived or purported security breaches of our cloud platform could result in actual, perceived or purported breaches of our customers’ networks and systems. our internal systems are exposed to the same cybersecurity risks and consequences of a breach as our customers and other enterprises. however, since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual, perceived or purported breach of, or security incident affecting, our internal networks, systems or data, could be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution and our business. additionally, many of our personnel work remotely on a hybrid or permanent basis, which may pose additional data security risks. further, our vendors and service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, and their systems and networks may be, or may have been, breached or contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to their or our systems and networks. our ability to monitor our vendors’ and service providers’ data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent their security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of our data, including confidential, sensitive, and other information about individuals. geo-political factors including international conflicts, such as between russia and ukraine and in the middle east, may increase the risk of such cyberattacks. any actual, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents that we suffer with regard to our platform, systems, networks or data, including any such actual, perceived or purported security breaches or security incidents    that result, or are believed to result, in actual, perceived or purported breaches of our customers’ networks or systems, could result in:  the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual, perceived or purported security breach or other security incident;"
ZS," negative publicity and damage to our reputation, brand, and market position;  harm to our relationships with, and a loss of, existing or potential customers or channel partners;   delayed or lost sales and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;  a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance; and  legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages and compensation to customers, customers of customers and business partners), litigation (including stockholder claims), regulatory inquiries or investigations and other liability. any of the above could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. while we maintain insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred in relation to actual, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents. we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation. if our cloud platform does not interoperate with our customers’ network and security infrastructure or with third-party products, websites or services, our cloud platform may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed. our cloud platform must interoperate with our customers’ existing network and security infrastructure. these complex systems are developed, delivered and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. as a result, the components of our customers’ infrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products and may be highly customized. we must be able to interoperate and provide our security services to customers with highly complex and customized networks, which requires careful planning and execution between our customers, our customer support teams and our channel partners. further, when new or updated elements of our customers’ infrastructure or new industry standards or protocols are introduced, we may have to update or enhance our cloud platform to allow us to continue to provide services to customers. our competitors or other vendors may refuse to work with us to allow their products to interoperate with our solutions, which could make it difficult for our cloud platform to function properly in customer networks that include these third-party products. we may not deliver or maintain interoperability quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. these efforts require capital investment and engineering resources. if we fail to maintain compatibility of our cloud platform with our customers’ network and security infrastructures, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our solutions, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and experience reduced demand for our services, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition."
ZS,
ZS,"risks related to our sales and operations if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a provider of high-quality security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and channel partners and our ability to attract new customers and channel partners. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality features and solutions for our cloud platform, uninterrupted delivery of our cloud services and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry or financial analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. additionally, the performance of our channel partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our channel partners’ services. the promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, we expand into new markets and more sales are generated through our channel partners. to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. if we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected. to increase the number of customers and increase the market acceptance of our platform, we will need to expand our sales and marketing operations, including our domestic and international sales force. although we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective customers. therefore, we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers. increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our cloud platform will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to expand and further invest in our sales and marketing operations and activities. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. we believe that selling a cloud-based security solution requires particularly talented sales personnel with the ability to communicate the transformative potential of our cloud platform. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining enough talented sales personnel in both the u.s. and international markets.  new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. as a result, our new hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain enough qualified individuals in the future. as a result of our rapid growth, a large percentage of our sales and marketing team is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned employees. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. the effectiveness of our sales and marketing has also varied over time and, together with the effectiveness of any partners or resellers we may engage, may vary in the future. our business and operating results may be harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are    unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. the timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our cloud platform, particularly with respect to large organizations. our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and the value proposition of our cloud platform. customers often view the subscription to our cloud platform as a significant decision as part of a strategic transformation initiative and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens the sales cycle. in addition, the impact of macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition by reducing sales, lengthening sales cycles and lowering prices for our services. we have experienced and may experience in the future increased scrutiny and a longer approval process for initial purchases by new customers, as a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions, and we cannot predict how long these economic conditions may persist. our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. platform purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue from a sale will be recognized. sales to larger customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller customers, which can act as a disincentive to our sales team to pursue these larger customers. these risks include:"
ZS," competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers;  increased purchasing power and leverage held by larger customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;  more stringent requirements in our support obligations; and  longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to purchase our solutions.  the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions, which are typically one to three years. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, may affect our revenue in future periods. additionally, subscriptions that are invoiced annually in advance or multi-year in advance contribute significantly to our short-term and long-term deferred revenue. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of"
ZS,"  operations until future periods. we may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. we provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer. our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our cloud platform. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. in addition, the limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheet for such commitments. our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers. our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support, including the quality of the support provided on our behalf by certain channel partners. failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we do not provide superior support to our customers, our ability to renew subscriptions, increase the number of users and sell additional services to customers may be adversely affected. we believe that successfully delivering our cloud solution requires a highly skilled level of customer support and engagement. we or our channel partners must assist our customers to deploy our cloud platform, resolve performance issues, address interoperability challenges with a customer’s existing network and security infrastructure and respond to security threats and cyberattacks. many enterprises, particularly large organizations, have very complex networks and require high levels of focused support, including premium support offerings, to fully realize the benefits of our cloud platform. any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and hurt our customer retention, particularly with respect to our large enterprise customers. additionally, if our channel partners do not provide support to the satisfaction of our customers, we may be required to provide this level of support to those customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. we may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our platform exceed our internal forecasts. we may also not be successful in our efforts to fully onboard new hires and provide adequate training to our employees, many of whom continue to work remotely. to the extent that we or our channel partners are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate support resources, our ability and the ability of our channel partners to provide adequate and timely support to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction with our cloud platform could be adversely affected. we currently rely in part on contractors provided by third-party service providers internationally to provide support services to our customers, and we expect to expand our international customer service support team to other countries. any failure to properly train or oversee such contractors could result in a poor customer experience and an adverse impact on our reputation and ability to renew subscriptions or engage new customers. furthermore, as we sell our solutions internationally, our support organization faces additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than english. any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could materially harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.   we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business. our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of jay chaudhry, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. we rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our business. in the last year, we have added several new senior management employees. any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves risk, especially nearly simultaneous changes involving so many leaders and employees, and any failure to transition effectively or to retain these new leaders could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters are located, and in other locations where we operate, is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications, security software and ai and ml solutions. in addition, the united states and other regions in which we operate have in the past and may again in the future experience acute workforce shortages for highly skilled workers, which in turn, can create hyper-competitive wage environments that may impact our ability to attract and retain employees. we have from time to time experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the ongoing cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees.  if we fail to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs, or if we need to materially increase the value of the compensation packages necessary to attract and retain these employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  our business depends, in part, on sales to the public sector and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such public sector organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with government organizations, and we believe the success and growth of our business will in part depend on our successful procurement of additional public sector customers. however, demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the public sector. sales to government entities are subject to substantial risks, including the following:  selling to government agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often involving significantly longer procurement cycles than commercial sales, and significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;  u.s. or other government requirements relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with the public sector affect how we and our channel partners do business with governmental agencies;    u.s. or other government certification requirements applicable to our cloud platform, including the federal risk and authorization management program (fedramp), are often difficult and costly to obtain and maintain and failure to do so will restrict our ability to sell to government customers;  government demand and payment for our services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and annual funding authorizations, including the impacts of possible government shutdowns, and government sales are inherently at risk of securing funding;"
ZS," sales to the u.s. and other governments are subject to procurement regulations, which impose heightened compliance obligations on us and our channel partners;  governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and compliance with procurement regulations and any unfavorable investigation or audit could result in fines, civil or criminal liability, further investigations, damage to our reputation and debarment from further government business; and  government customers procuring commercial items get the benefit of more favorable terms and conditions by operation of law, regardless of agreed upon contractual terms.  the occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future and could result in temporary suspension or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. any such penalties, disruptions or limitations in our or our channel partners' ability to do business with the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. our international operations expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could materially and adversely impact our business. historically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from outside the united states. we derived approximately 50%, 50% and 51% of our revenue from our international customers in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. as of july 31, 2024, approximately 63% of our full-time employees were located outside of the united states. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes continued expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. we expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. these international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including:  political, economic and social uncertainty or international conflict, such as the current conflicts between russia and ukraine and in the middle east;  unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;  greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection, and longer collection periods;  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and tax laws and treaties;  greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors and resellers to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, anti-bribery laws, export and import control laws, trade and economic sanctions and any applicable trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;"
ZS,"   requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;  increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;  difficulties in complying with regulations relating to ai and ml;  greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;  differing employment practices and labor relations issues;  difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;  fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business, including the british pound, indian rupee and euro, and related impact on sales cycles; and"
ZS," the impact of natural disasters and public health pandemics and epidemics on customers, partners, suppliers, employees, travel and the global economy. as we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business. future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects. our business strategy includes acquiring other complementary solutions, technologies or businesses. we have in the past acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. in order to expand our security offerings and features, we also may enter into relationships with other businesses, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or investments in other companies. negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control. consequently, we cannot assure you that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close. these kinds of acquisitions or investments may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. in particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and services, personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired business choose not to work for us. we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or using or continuing the development of the acquired technologies. acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities. moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. in connection with these types of transactions, we may:  issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;"
ZS,"   use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;  incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;  incur large charges or substantial liabilities;  encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures;  experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to new acquisitions or investments;   experience delays in our quarterly close process and related filings with the sec; and  become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.  these challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. if we are unable to effectively manage certain risks and challenges related to our india operations, our business could be harmed. we believe that our significant presence in india provides important advantages for our business, such as direct access to a large pool of skilled professionals. however, it also creates certain risks that we must effectively manage. as of july 31, 2024, 37% of our global work force is based in india and is comprised mostly of r&d, finance and operations professionals. wage costs in india for skilled professionals are currently lower than in the united states for comparably skilled professionals. however, wages and benefit costs in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states, which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals. there is intense competition in india for skilled technical professionals, and we expect such competition to increase. as a result, we may be unable to retain our current employee base in india or hire additional new talent or do so cost-effectively. in addition, india has recently experienced significant inflation and low growth. india also has experienced natural disasters, civil unrest and terrorism and, in the past, has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries. if we are unable to effectively manage any of the foregoing risks related to our india operations, our development efforts and operations could be impaired, which could materially and negatively impact our growth and operating results. our failure to raise additional capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new solutions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and notes repayment requirements for at least the next 12 months. we may, however, need to raise additional funds to fund our operating expenses, make capital purchases, acquire or invest in business or technology, and we may not be able to obtain those funds on favorable terms, or at all. if we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of our debt would have priority over the holders of our common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock, though we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. we may also be required to take other actions, any of which could harm our business and operating results. if we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing, or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.  "
ZS,"risks related to information technology, intellectual property, data security and privacy the actual or perceived failure of our cloud platform to block malware or prevent a security breach or incident could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. our cloud platform may fail to detect or prevent security breaches or incidents for any number of reasons. our cloud platform is complex and may contain performance issues that are not detected until after its deployment. we also provide frequent solution updates and fundamental enhancements, which increase the possibility of errors, and our reporting, tracking, monitoring and quality assurance procedures may not be sufficient to ensure we detect any such defects in a timely manner. the performance of our cloud platform can be negatively impacted by our failure to enhance, expand or update our cloud platform, bugs, errors or defects in our software, improper classification of websites by our vendors who provide us with lists of malicious websites, improper deployment or configuration of our services and many other factors. in addition, the techniques used by cyber threat actors, including state sponsored actors, to access or sabotage networks and other systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. as a result, there is a risk that a cyber threat could emerge that our services are unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are impacted. the growth in state sponsored cyber activity showcases the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and dramatically expands the global threat landscape. moreover, as our services are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind cyber threats will focus on finding ways to defeat our services. if this happens, our cloud platform could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and create the perception that our cloud platform is not capable of providing superior security, which, in turn, could have a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions. further, high profile security breaches or incidents, in particular those of cloud-based service providers, may cause our customers and potential customers to lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and with respect to security in particular, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers. increasingly, enterprises are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, including traditional threat actors, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), social engineering attacks (such as deep fakes), targeted phishing attacks made more sophisticated with the development of ai and ml, distributed denial-of-service attacks, advanced attacks conducted or sponsored by nation-states, advanced persistent threat intrusions, ransomware and other malware and theft or misuse of intellectual property or business or personal data, including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors. no security solution, including our cloud platform, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security breach or incident. our customers typically rely on complex network and security infrastructures, which include products and services from multiple vendors, to secure their networks. if any of our customers becomes infected with malware or experiences a security breach or incident, they could be disappointed with our services, regardless of whether our services are intended to block the attack or would have blocked the attack if the customer had properly configured our cloud platform. additionally, if any enterprises that are publicly known to use our services are the subject of a cyberattack that becomes publicized, our current or potential customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our services. from time to time, industry or financial analysts and research firms test our solutions against other security products. our services may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons, including misconfiguration. to the extent potential customers, industry or financial analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our services do not provide significant value, our reputation and business could be materially harmed. any real or perceived flaws in our cloud platform or any real, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents of our customers could result in:    a loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;   delayed or lost sales and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;   a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;   the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual, perceived or purported security breach or incident;"
ZS," negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand; and   legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages, and compensation to customers and business partners), litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations and other liability.  any of the above results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, with data security being a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make public statements in our policies, on our website, and elsewhere describing the security of our platform and the performance of our solutions. as a result, we may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices alleging these statements are not accurate, brought by the u.s. federal trade commission, state, local or foreign regulators and private litigants. issues in the development, use and execution of ai and ml, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may harm our business. we are increasingly utilizing and have recently begun building and executing ai and ml capabilities, including, for example, those relating to generative ai and large language models, into our product offerings. the rapid evolution of ai and ml requires the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that ai and ml are implemented responsibly in order to benefit our business, while also minimizing any unintended or harmful impact. as with many developing technologies, ai and ml present risks and challenges, many of which may be unknown, that could affect their further development, adoption, and use. these risks and challenges could undermine public confidence in ai and ml, which could slow or even halt its adoption and negatively affect our business. further, a quickly evolving legal and regulatory environment may cause us to incur increased research and development costs, or divert resources from other development efforts, to address social and ethical issues related to ai and ml. the use of ai technologies also presents emerging ethical issues that could become controversial. as a result of these and other challenges associated with our use and implementation of ai and ml, we may in the future be subject to legal liability, competitive harm, regulatory action, including new proposed rules and legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union, new applications of existing data protection, privacy, cybersecurity, information security, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm.  we incorporate technology from third parties into our cloud platform, and our inability to obtain or maintain rights to the technology could harm our business. we license software and other technology from third parties that we incorporate into or integrate with, our cloud platform. we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our services. in addition, many licenses are non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license any of this technology for any reason, our ability to develop and sell our services containing such technology could be harmed. similarly, if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties"
ZS,"  now or in the future, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this could limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and services and increase our costs of production. as a result, our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed. additionally, as part of our longer-term strategy to grow our business, we may consider opening our cloud platform to third-party developers and applications to further extend its functionality, but we cannot be certain that such efforts to grow our business will be successful. some of our technology incorporates ""open source"" software, and we license some of our software through open source projects, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation. our solutions incorporate software licensed by third parties under open source licenses, including open source software included in software we receive from third-party commercial software vendors. use of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, updates or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. in addition, the wide availability of open source software used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. and other courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or commercialize our solutions. as a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. in addition, by the terms of some open source licenses, under certain conditions we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, including authorizing further modification and redistribution. in the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to such requirements by an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. further, if we are held to have breached or otherwise failed to comply with the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to release certain of our proprietary source code under open source licenses, pay monetary damages, seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our services on terms that are not economically feasible or be subject to injunctions that could require us to discontinue the sale of our services if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis. many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will be effective. responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, or discovering open source software code in our platform could harm our business, operating results and financial condition by, among other things:"
ZS," resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation;  diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business;  requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;  causing delays in the deployment of our platform or service offerings to our customers;  requiring us to stop offering certain services on or features of our platform;  requiring us to redesign certain components of our platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense;"
ZS,"   requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and  requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform, and any disruption in the availability of these components could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network or replace defective equipment in our existing data centers. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform and provide services to our customers. our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over production costs and constraints based on the then-current availability, terms and pricing of these components. for example, we generally purchase these components on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. in addition, the technology industry has experienced component shortages, delivery delays and price increases in the past, and we may experience shortages, delays or materially increased costs, including as a result of natural disasters, acts of war or international conflicts, epidemics or global pandemics, increased demand in the industry or if our suppliers do not have sufficient rights to supply the components in all jurisdictions in which we may host our services. while global economic conditions have not yet had a material impact on our supply chain, these conditions have increased our costs in the past and could result in disruptions and delays for components in the future. for instance, there is a risk that current geopolitical, diplomatic and other developments affecting the relationship between china and taiwan may materially and negatively impact the availability of certain critical components that we use in our data centers, which we source from overseas. if our supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, there can be no assurance that additional supplies or components can serve as adequate replacements for the existing components or that supplies will be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. any disruption or delay in the supply of our components may delay opening new data centers, delay increasing capacity or replacing defective equipment at existing data centers or cause other constraints on our operations that could damage our channel partner or customer relationships. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. a number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they previously developed, have purchased or otherwise obtained. many companies, including our competitors, may now, and in the future, have significantly larger and more mature patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret portfolios than we have, which they may use to assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us. in addition, intellectual property litigation may involve non-practicing entities or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. third parties have asserted in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us and these claims, even without merit, could harm our business, including by increasing our costs, reducing our revenue, creating customer concerns that result in delayed or reduced sales, distracting our management from the running of our business and requiring us to cease use of important intellectual property. in addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our services. moreover, in a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. the strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. however, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. in the united states, issued patents    enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by the discovery process. as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims. third parties have in the past and may in the future also assert infringement claims against our customers or channel partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. in addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such employees have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. from time to time, the u.s. supreme court, other u.s. federal courts and the u.s. patent and trademark appeals board, and their foreign counterparts, have made and may continue to make changes to the interpretation of patent laws in their respective jurisdictions. we cannot predict future changes to the interpretation of existing patent laws or whether u.s. or foreign legislative bodies will amend such laws in the future. any changes may lead to uncertainties or increased costs and risks surrounding the outcome of third-party infringement claims brought against us and the actual or enhanced damages, including treble damages, that may be awarded in connection with any such current or future claims and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  we are unable to predict the likelihood of success in defending against future infringement claims. in the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. if we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. even if we were to prevail, third-party infringement lawsuits could be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, deter channel partners from selling or licensing our services and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our services, which would also materially harm our business. in addition, any public announcements of the results of any proceedings in third-party infringement lawsuits could be negatively perceived by industry or financial analysts and investors and could cause our stock price to experience volatility or decline. further, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations."
ZS,"any of these events could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. we believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and our patents, trademarks and copyrights may be held invalid or unenforceable. moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. we have filed for patents in the united states and in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions, but such"
ZS,"  protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. for example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. additionally, the u.s. patent and trademark office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and to maintain issued patents. there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. if this occurs, it could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, and even if we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. in addition, our intellectual property may be stolen, including by cybercrimes, and we may not be able to identify the perpetrators or prevent the exploitation of our intellectual property by our competitors or others. protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the united states. any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, either of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. the inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents."
ZS,"adverse economic conditions or reduced it security spending may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. our operations and performance depend in part on worldwide economic conditions and the impact these conditions have on levels of spending on it networking and security solutions. our business depends on the overall demand for these solutions and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to purchase our security services. a broad reduction in it security spending would have a material impact to our business. the united states and the global economy have recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. while inflation rates moderated in 2023 and continue to moderate into 2024, the existence of inflation in the u.s. and global economy and the pricing pressure created by rising inflation in prior periods has and may continue to result in high interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. elevated inflation rates can affect our expenses, especially employee compensation. in addition, rising interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cash on hand and increase our borrowing costs. inflation and related increases in interest rates could also increase our customers' operating costs, which could result in reduced it budgets, less demand for our solutions, or delays in new orders, renewals or payments due to us. governments have and are implementing fiscal policy interventions in response to high levels of inflation, including raising interest rates or keeping them at elevated levels. even if these interventions lower inflation to desirable levels, they may also reduce economic growth rates, create recessions and increase unemployment rates. this could have an adverse"
ZS,"  effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. for example, if our customers were to reduce their it budgets or workforces in response to deteriorating economic conditions, they may not purchase or renew subscriptions for our services or may renew for fewer users or less expensive services. these policy changes have provided a benefit to us as a result of the increased interest income we earn on our cash and investments, but a reduction of interest rates in the future would reduce this income. the impact of economic conditions, including the ongoing effects of inflation, high interest rates and regional or global recessions could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways, including by reducing sales, lengthening sales cycles and requiring us to lower prices for our services. risks relating to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and cybersecurity, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in addition, emerging tools and technologies we utilize in providing our products, like ai and ml, are subject to regulation under new laws as well as new applications of existing laws. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states. these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business. noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:"
ZS," investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions;  mandatory changes to our cloud platform;  disgorgement of profits, fines and damages;  civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;  claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;  termination of contracts; and   loss of intellectual property rights. if any government sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. as a global employer, we are subject to various labor laws, including worker classification laws, that impact compliance obligations regarding working time, proper payment for time worked, time off regulations, as well as anti-retaliation, discrimination and harassment policies and compliance with employee representative rights. we take reasonable efforts to comply with applicable labor laws and regulations impacting our workforce, but failure to comply with such laws could result in government enforcement actions and penalties, may negatively impact business operations and may be harmful to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain employees."
ZS,"  these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners or customers, penalties, termination of contracts and loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property.  if we were not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements or regulations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. the regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security matters are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. our handling of personal data is subject to various data protection, cybersecurity, information security and other telecommunications regulations or requirements where we offer our solutions around the world. we also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other cybersecurity or information security or data protection-related organizations that require us to comply with rules pertaining to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and information security. further, we may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations and other actual and asserted obligations, such as industry standards, relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data. changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could also impact our business. the u.s. federal government, and various state and foreign governments, have adopted or proposed laws and regulations on the collection, distribution, use, storage and other processing of information relating to individuals. such laws and regulations may, among other things, require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit customers to access, correct and delete information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their information and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ consent to use information for certain purposes. for example, the california consumer privacy act, or ccpa, took effect in january 2020 and was subsequently modified by the california privacy rights act, or cpra, which took effect in january 2023. numerous other states have enacted, and others are expected to enact, privacy laws that have gone into effect, or will go into effect through 2026, and a federal privacy law is being considered. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the u.s. for example, the european union has implemented the general data protection regulation, which provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling, storage and other processing of information relating to individuals and fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. the number of emerging and existing data protection, privacy and security laws and regulations creates the risk that obligations may be interpreted inconsistently between jurisdictions which may generate tension with our efforts to align our practices to comply with our privacy, data protection, and security obligations globally. many of these laws and regulations impose substantial penalties for noncompliance.  we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, information security and telecommunications services jurisdictions in which we operate or may operate, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. needing to address new and evolving laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, relating to privacy, data protection or security could require us to modify our solutions, restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. new and evolving requirements may increase compliance costs, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability, may require additional contractual negotiations, and may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. in view of the foregoing, we cannot assure our compliance with all such laws, regulations, standards and obligations. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards or actual or asserted obligations, or any actual, perceived or purported security breach or other security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of information relating to individuals or other data, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions and other proceedings, private claims and    litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and prospective customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. we are subject to governmental export and import controls and trade and economic sanctions that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our business activities are subject to various restrictions under u.s. export and similar laws and regulations, including the u.s. department of commerce's export administration regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control. the u.s. export controls and trade and economic sanctions include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries and governments of these countries, as well as other persons and entities. for example, the u.s. and other countries have implemented economic and other sanctions, as well as increased export controls in response to the current conflict between russia and ukraine. these measures have continued to increase. these export controls and sanctions and any additional restrictions may impact our ability to continue to operate in russia and other affected regions. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide our services and software and operate our cloud platform or could limit our customers’ ability to access or use our services or software in those countries. although we take precautions to prevent our services and software from being provided in violation of such laws, our services and software may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. we may also be materially and adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. in addition, changes in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions and import laws and regulations, could delay the introduction and sale of subscriptions to our platform in international markets, prevent users in certain countries from accessing our services or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our services to certain countries, governments, persons or entities altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform or provide software to existing customers or potential new customers with international operations. any decrease in our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform or provide software could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."
ZS,"we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results. the vast majority of our sales contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our customers outside of the united states, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, a portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states, and is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the british pound, indian rupee, euro, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen, and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we are also exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. we have a foreign currency risk management program, in which we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which we designate as cash flow hedges. we also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. the use of"
ZS,"  these hedging activities may not be successful in effectively mitigating the potentially adverse impact on our financial statements due to unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. further, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions."
ZS,"we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, and non-collateralized interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements may default, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. in times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the impaired liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of such a default, we could incur significant losses, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations. we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business in international markets. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate the business flows and future growth into the international markets, and consider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. for example, certain jurisdictions have recently introduced a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering enacting similar laws. the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to the intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, or if there are changes in tax laws or the way existing tax laws are interpreted or applied, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. in 2021, the organization for economic cooperation and development announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the pillar two legislation, which will apply to us beginning in fiscal 2025. management is currently assessing the jurisdictions that could give rise to additional taxation as well as any potential impacts as a result of the implementation of the rules. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited."
ZS,"  as of july 31, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards for u.s. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of approximately $1,497.6 million and $630.8 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. beginning in 2024, $554.9 million of state net operating losses will begin to expire at different periods. the remaining $75.9 million of state net operating losses will carry forward indefinitely. as of july 31, 2024, we had foreign net operating loss carryforward of $75.6 million, all of which will be carried forward indefinitely.  as of july 31, 2024, we also had u.s. federal, california, and foreign research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of $133.4 million, $73.9 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. if not utilized, the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring at different periods beginning in 2033. our california research and development tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely. foreign tax credits will begin to expire in the fiscal year ending 2029. realization of these net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that a portion of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ""ownership change,"" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership by ""5% shareholders"" over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. as a result, in the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we experience one or more ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset u.s. federal taxable liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. furthermore, our state carryforwards may be subject to similar and additional limitations.  taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results. risks related to the ownership of our common stock the concentration of our stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval. as of july 31, 2024, our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 43.2% of our common stock outstanding with jay chaudhry, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, and his affiliates beneficially owning approximately 17.6% of our common stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have significant control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. corporate action might be    taken even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other stockholders may view as beneficial. certain provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. these provisions include:  a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;  the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;"
ZS," a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;  the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;  the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to affect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;  the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and  advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.  these provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time."
ZS,"  the market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including those described in this ""risk factors"" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:"
ZS," actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;  the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;  industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec;  rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock from time to time;  changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;  the sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;  issuances of shares of our common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes;  failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;  litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;  developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;  announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;  actual or perceived privacy, data protection, or security incidents or breaches;  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and our responses thereto;  any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to mr. chaudhry;"
ZS,"   general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and  other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, global pandemics or responses to these events.  in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. we may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments."
ZS,"if industry or financial analysts issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. in addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline."
ZS,"  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the federal district courts of the united states are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees."
ZS,"our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for:  any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;  any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;  any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;  any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and  any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the united states are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended. each of these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. risks related to the notes servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business or the ability to raise funds to pay our substantial debt. on june 25, 2020, we issued $1,150 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2025, or the notes, which mature on july 1, 2025. we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest, principal or other required payments on our indebtedness. for instance, holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (which is defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date for such notes. additionally, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2025 notes being converted. our ability to make such payments or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments. our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. if we are unable to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, it could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition."
ZS,"  the conditional conversion feature of the notes, when triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. during any period, the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. during the three months ended july 31, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert were not met. if one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. as a result of the upcoming maturity date of the notes (july 1, 2025), we have classified the notes as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of july 31, 2024, which may be seen as a material adverse reduction of our net working capital."
ZS,"the capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock. in connection with the pricing of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions, or the option counterparties. the capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.  we have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. in addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion, repurchase or redemption of the notes, to the extent we exercise the relevant election under the capped call transactions). this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions. the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. in addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties."
ZS,
ZS,"general risks our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, acts of war, international conflicts, terrorism, and security breaches or incidents. our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or public health emergency, occurring at our headquarters, in india, where we have a significant facility, or where a key channel partner or data center is located could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect our component suppliers or other third-party providers, including our network bandwidth providers, this could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide services in a timely or cost-effective manner.  in addition, natural disasters, acts of war, international conflicts, such as the current conflicts between russia and ukraine and in the middle east, terrorism and other geopolitical unrest or health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic disease, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our or our customers’ businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. in addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and may become more frequent and effective through the use of ai, and our internal systems may be victimized by such attacks. although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, security breaches and incidents and loss of critical data. though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our platform to the satisfaction of our users may materially harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, the u.k. bribery act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. we leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our platform and conduct our business abroad. we and these third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. any investigations, actions or sanctions could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.   if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, or the sarbanes-oxley act, and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market, or nasdaq. the requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we have developed our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the sec under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and provide significant management oversight. any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. if our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline. in addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on nasdaq. pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. this assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. during the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec.   if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or gaap, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled ""management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."" the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements include those related to determination of revenue recognition, deferred revenue, deferred contract acquisition costs, capitalized internal-use software, valuation of acquired intangible assets, period of benefit generated from our deferred contract acquisition costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of common stock options and stock-based awards, useful lives of property and equipment, useful lives of acquired intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, loss contingencies related to litigation, fair value of the notes and the discount rate used for operating leases. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results.   we rely on third parties for certain essential financial and operational services, and a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. we rely on third parties to provide many essential financial and operational services to support our business. many of these vendors are less established and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. moreover, these vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. as a result, we depend upon these vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes. any failure by these vendors to do so, or any disruption in our ability to access the internet, would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our operations."
ZS,"we may become involved in litigation that may materially and adversely affect us. from time to time, we may become, involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. in addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects."

NET,"item 1a. risk factors our business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects, and could cause the trading price of our class a common stock to decline. our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. in that event, the market price of our class a common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. our risk factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part. risks related to our business and our industry we have a history of net losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. we have incurred net losses in all periods since we began operations and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we experienced net losses of $183.9 million, $193.4 million, and $260.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and as of december 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,023.8 million. because the markets for our products are rapidly evolving, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we continue to hire additional personnel, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, and continue to develop our products. if we fail to increase our revenue to offset the increases in our operating expenses, we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future."
NET,"we have experienced rapid revenue growth, which may not be indicative of our future performance. we have experienced rapid revenue growth in recent periods, with revenue of $1,296.7 million, $975.2 million, and $656.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. however, our rate of revenue growth has slowed in recent periods and may continue to slow in future periods. you should not consider our recent growth in revenue as indicative of our future performance. in particular, our revenue growth rates may continue to slow or decline in the future and may not be sufficient to achieve and sustain profitability, as we also expect our costs to increase in future periods. we believe that historical comparisons of our revenue may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. accordingly, you should not rely on our revenue and other growth for any prior quarter or year as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. our historical rapid growth and fluctuations in our growth rate more recently may also make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. if we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. adverse economic conditions, including reduced spending on products and solutions for network security, performance, and reliability, may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. our operations and financial performance depend in part on worldwide economic conditions and the impact these conditions have on levels of spending on products and solutions for network security, performance, and reliability. our business depends on the overall demand for these products and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to purchase our products. the united states, europe, and the united kingdom have recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. although inflation levels have begun to decrease in the united states, the united kingdom, and eurozone, the u.s. federal reserve, the european central bank, and the bank of england have raised, and may continue to raise or maintain, high interest rates and may implement fiscal policy interventions. even if these interventions lower inflation, they may also reduce economic growth rates, create a recession, and result in other similar or unexpected effects. for example, the decrease in values of government-issued securities resulting from higher interest rates may have played a significant role in the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank during the first quarter of 2023, the circumstances resulting in the ubs takeover of credit suisse during the second quarter of 2023, and generalized uncertainty confronting a number of other financial institutions.  downturns in economic conditions — including inflation, rising interest rates, reductions in business confidence and activity, the curtailment of government or corporate spending, volatile financial markets, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of additional financial institutions, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and reduced demand for products and services across a variety of industries — have in the past and may in the future affect our business and our current and prospective customers and their industries adversely. for example, during an economic downturn, our current and prospective customers may suffer from reduced operating budgets. some of our paying customers may view a subscription to our products as a discretionary purchase and may reduce their discretionary spending on our products or reduce or cut their budget to otherwise expand their subscriptions to our products. moreover, our competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. further, the sales cycle for new customers of our technology and services could lengthen in the future as a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions, resulting in a potentially longer delay between increasing operating expenses and the generation of corresponding revenue, if any. for example, potentially as a result of these various macroeconomic impacts on our customers, since the first half of 2022, we periodically have experienced lengthening of the average sales cycles for certain types of customers and sales, slowdowns in our pipeline of potential new customers and in the rate of converting sales pipeline opportunities into new sales, increases in average days sales outstanding, higher levels of churn in our paying customer base (which is when any of our paying customers cease to be a paying customer for any reason, including any pay-as-you-go customer converting to a free subscription plan), and lengthening of the timing of payment from some of our customers, all of which may have contributed to a slowdown in our revenue growth over that period (including with respect to new customers). we may also experience increases in new and existing customers requesting concessions in terms of payment amounts and/or timing and earlier or additional termination rights in the future as the challenging macroeconomic conditions continue or worsen. we continue to monitor economic conditions to assess possible implications to our business and to take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the adverse consequences of uncertainty or negative trends. however, there can be no assurances that initiatives we undertake will be sufficient or successful. if there is an economic downturn that affects our current and prospective customers, or if we are unable to address and mitigate the risks associated with any of the foregoing, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or the worsening or expansion of those conflicts or tensions, and any related challenging macroeconomic conditions globally and in various countries in which we and our customers operate may materially adversely affect our customers, vendors, and partners, and the duration and extent to which these factors may impact our future business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows remain uncertain. the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, or other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening or expansion of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions, and any related challenging macroeconomic  conditions globally, could decrease the spending of our existing and potential new customers, adversely affect demand for our products, cause one or more of our customers, vendors, and partners to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, cause one or more of our customers to fail to renew, terminate, or seek to renegotiate their contracts with us, affect the ability of our sales team to travel to potential customers, impact expected spending from existing and potential new customers, and negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  any of the negative impacts of the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions, and any related challenging macroeconomic conditions, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, also could exacerbate many of the other risk factors discussed in this part i, item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10-k, including volatility in the trading prices of our class a common stock. the full extent to which these factors will negatively affect our business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity, and duration of the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, and any economic downturns and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response. if we are unable to attract new paying and free customers, our future results of operations could be harmed. the success of our business principally depends on our ability to attract new paying and free customers. to do so, we must persuade decision makers at potential customers that our products offer significant advantages over those of our competitors. other factors, many of which are out of our control, may now or in the future impact our ability to add new paying and free customers, including:  potential customers’ commitments to existing equipment or vendors;  potential customers’ greater familiarity and/or comfort with on-premises, appliance-based products and concerns about potential risks associated with using cloud-based solutions;  actual or perceived switching costs;  our failure to develop new products and features, and to adapt to technological developments, that our potential customers' demand, including potential large customers;  the failure of our new or existing products and features to perform in the manner demanded or expected by potential customers and our existing customers, particularly large customers;  delays in the general availability release of products and features after we have announced their development or beta availability;  our failure to generate demand for our products through effective marketing efforts related to our business and products;   our failure to obtain additional, or maintain existing, government or industry security certifications for our network and products, such as the federal risk and authorization management program (fedramp) moderate authorization that we achieved in 2022;  negative media, industry, or financial analyst commentary regarding our products and our network and the identities and activities of some of our paying and free customers;  the adoption of new, or amendment of existing, laws, rules, or regulations that negatively impact the utility of, or increase the risk of using, cloud-based solutions generally or our network and products specifically, including changes in new or modified laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security;  our failure to effectively recruit, expand, develop, retain, and motivate our sales and marketing personnel;  our failure to develop or expand relationships with existing channel partners or to attract new channel partners;  our failure to help or provide support to our customers, particularly large customers, in order to successfully deploy and use our products in a manner required by them, their industry, or applicable regulators;  our failure to educate our customers about our network and products;  the perceived risk, commencement, or outcome of litigation;   deteriorating general economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, and the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of financial institutions; and  impacts of the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts or other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening or expansion of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions. we believe that the importance of brand recognition for attracting new customers will increase as we introduce new products and continue to expand into new markets. however, the promotion of our brand may require substantial expenditures. we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to increase our brand awareness, both generally and in specific geographies and to specific customer groups. there can be no assurance that our brand development strategies and investment of resources will enhance recognition of our brand or lead to an increased customer base.  if our efforts to attract new paying customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline, we may not achieve profitability, and our future results of operations could be materially harmed. if our efforts to attract new free customers are not successful, the benefits to our network and product development cycles from our strategy of providing a free subscription plan will be diminished. our business depends on our ability to retain and upgrade paying customers, expand the number of products we sell to paying customers, and, to a lesser extent, convert free customers to paying customers, and any decline in renewals, upgrades, expansions, or conversions could adversely affect our future results of operations. our business is subscription-based and it is important for our business and financial results that our paying customers renew their subscriptions for our products when existing contract terms expire. our pay-as-you-go customers pay with a credit card on a monthly or annual basis and can terminate their subscriptions, or switch to less expensive subscription plans, at will with little advance notice. because pay-as-you-go customers that subscribe to our basic subscription plans are an important source of revenue, this ease of termination could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. our contracted customers, which consist of customers that sign up for our enterprise plan, enter into longer term agreements typically ranging from one to three years, and they generally have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products after the expiration of their contractual period and are allowed to cancel their subscriptions in the case of our uncured material breach of the agreement. some contracted customers also have agreements that allow them to terminate the agreement without cause upon little or no advance written notice, or upon our failure to meet certain service level commitments, or to obtain and maintain industry security certifications within a specified time frame. should certain of our contracted customers, especially our large customers, terminate their agreements, or reduce their expenditures, with us, our financial condition and results of operations may materially suffer. in addition, as we continue to increase our number of large customers, and the amount of revenue we receive from large customers, this risk may increase. due to our varied customer base and short average subscription periods, it is difficult to accurately predict our long-term customer retention rate. our customer retention may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with the security, performance, and reliability of our products and our global network, our development and general availability release of new products and features and adaptation to technological developments, our prices and subscription plans, our ability to provide adequate customer support or otherwise address customer concerns with our products, our customers’ budgetary restrictions (including reductions in spending as a result of uncertain economic conditions or overall industry uncertainty), mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and business partnerships and relationships involving our customers, failure or bankruptcy of our customers, the perception that competitive products provide better or less expensive options, negative public perception of us or our free and paying customers, concerns about new or amended laws, rules, or regulations that increase the risk of using cloud-based solutions or our network and products specifically, and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future financial performance also depends in part on our ability to continue to upgrade paying customers to higher-tier subscriptions, expand the number of products we sell to paying customers, and, to a lesser extent, to convert free customers into paying customers. conversely, our paying customers may convert to lower-cost or free plans or reduce the number of products they purchase from us if they do not see the marginal value in paying for  our higher-cost plans or for our specific products, or due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and/or reduced operating budgets, thereby impacting our ability to increase revenue. for example, during the second and third quarters of 2022, we experienced a higher level of churn in our paying customer base (which is when any of our paying customers cease to be a paying customer for any reason, including any pay-as-you-go customer converting to a free subscription plan). moreover, our free customers have no obligation to transition to paying customers at any point. in order to expand our commercial relationship with our customers, existing paying and free customers must decide that the incremental cost associated with such an upgrade in their subscription plans, the purchase of additional, or the expanded use of their currently used, products is justified by the additional functionality they would gain. for example, some of our paying customers may decide that our enterprise plan offerings do not provide sufficient incremental value to upgrade from our pay-as-you-go offering or to continue any such previously chosen upgrade. our customers’ decisions whether to upgrade their subscription, purchase additional, or expand current usage, of our products or to continue any such previously chosen upgrade or purchased products are driven by a number of factors, including customer satisfaction with the security, performance, and reliability of our network and products, customer security and networking issues and requirements, general economic conditions, and customer reaction to the price for additional products. if our efforts to expand our relationship with our existing paying and free customers are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations may materially suffer. if we are unable to effectively attract, expand, and retain sales to large customers, or we fail to mitigate the additional risks associated with serving large customers, our business, results of operation, and financial condition may suffer. our growth strategy is dependent, in large part, upon attracting, expanding, and retaining sales to large customers. for our definition of “large customers,” see part ii, item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. attracting, expanding, and retaining sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller customers, including:   competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such larger enterprise customers, including companies that seek to bundle sales of their new or existing products that are competitive to our products, or that may have more experienced sales personnel or greater budgetary resources available or committed to such larger enterprise customers;  longer evaluation periods, more detailed evaluations, and more cumbersome contract negotiation and approval processes, including potential requirements for such purchasing decisions to be approved by senior executives of such companies;  increased purchasing power and leverage in negotiating pricing terms and other contractual arrangements with us;  requirements for more technically complex configurations, integrations, deployments, or features;  greater customer support or assistance with migrating their systems from another vendor to our network and products;  more stringent requirements in terms of the security, performance, and reliability of our products and our network and our support and compliance obligations related to our products;  increased usage of our global network that may require us to incur greater network infrastructure expenditures; and  longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to purchase, expand, or continue to purchase our products. historically, the implementation period to start using, or expanding the use of, our products has been short, with most customers under our pay-as-you-go plans implementing usage of our products within a matter of minutes and our sales cycle for customers under our enterprise plan lasted less than one quarter. since the first half of 2022, however, we have experienced periodic lengthening of our average sales cycle for our new and existing large customers, and the lengthening of our sales cycle to our large customers could continue in the future to the extent that macroeconomic conditions further deteriorate. in addition, as our sales force continues to target an increasing number of large customers for new and expanded product sales, these larger enterprises often undertake a more significant evaluation and negotiation processes than we have experienced in the past, which could further lengthen our sales cycle materially. in addition, our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective large customers about the uses, benefits, and value proposition of our network and products. our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers and our channel partners through account penetration, account coordination, sales, and overall market development. potential large customers often view the subscription to our products, including any expansion of those subscriptions, as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, in some cases require considerable time to evaluate, test, and qualify our network and products prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. as a result, we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. subscriptions to our products, including expanded subscriptions, often are subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unanticipated administrative, processing, and other delays. in addition, some of our subscription agreements with our large customers may have more favorable early termination rights, greater usage-based pricing than is the case with our customary subscription-based agreements with our contracted customers and our pay-as-you-go customers, or generate lower margins than other contracted customers. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether or when a sale to a prospective large customer will be completed, how much incremental revenue or gross profit will result from such sales over the duration of the agreement, and when revenue from a subscription will be recognized or will cease.  further, our ability to improve our sales of products to large customers is dependent on us continuing to attract and retain sales personnel with experience in selling to larger enterprises. also, because security breaches or a network outage with respect to larger, high-profile enterprises are likely to be heavily publicized, there is increased liability and reputational risks associated with serving these customers if we experience a security breach or network outage. we also believe that large customers may be more likely than our smaller customers to terminate or reduce their usage of our products in such circumstances. once we begin selling to a large customer or expand our sales to a large customer, if we fail to retain the large customer or to retain the same amount of sales to the large customer, then the adverse impact on our result of operations and financial conditions could be significant during any specific quarter and could also result in potentially greater and unexpected variability in our results of operations and financial condition from quarter to quarter. activities of our paying and free customers or the content of their websites or other internet properties, as well as our response to those activities, could cause us to experience significant adverse political, business, and reputational consequences with customers, employees, suppliers, government entities, and others. activities of our paying and free customers or the content of their websites and other internet properties could cause us to experience significant adverse political, business, and reputational consequences with customers, employees, suppliers, government entities, and other third parties. even if we comply with legal obligations to remove or disable customer content, we may maintain relationships with customers that others find hostile, offensive, or inappropriate. for example, we experienced significant negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by the daily stormer, a neo-nazi, white supremacist website, around the time of the 2017 protests in charlottesville, virginia. we also received negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by 8chan, a forum website that served as inspiration for the 2019 attacks in el paso, texas and christchurch, new zealand. in 2022, we received negative publicity in connection with the use of our network by kiwi farms, a forum website tied to harassment campaigns and direct threats toward individuals. we are aware of some potential customers that have indicated their decision to not subscribe to our products was impacted, at least in part, by the actions or potential actions of certain of our paying and free customers. we may also experience other adverse political, business and reputational consequences with prospective and current customers, employees, suppliers, and others related to the activities of our paying and free customers, especially if such hostile, offensive, or inappropriate use is highly publicized. conversely, actions we take in response to the activities of our paying and free customers, up to and including banning them from using our products, may harm our brand and reputation. following the events in charlottesville, virginia, we terminated the account of the daily stormer. similarly, following the events in el paso, texas, we terminated the account of 8chan, and following escalating, direct threats towards individuals in september 2022, we blocked access to kiwi farms content through our infrastructure. we received significant adverse feedback for these decisions from those concerned about our ability to pass judgment on our customers and the users of our network and products, or to censor them by limiting their access to our products, and we are aware of potential customers who decided not to subscribe to our products because of this. although offering a free plan for certain of our products is an important part of our business strategy, we may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits of this strategy and the costs and other detriments associated with our free plan could outweigh the benefits we receive from our free customers. we have historically offered a free plan for certain of our products. we believe that this strategy is valuable to us and it is an important part of our overall business strategy. however, to the extent that we do not achieve the expected benefits of this strategy, our business may be adversely affected by the costs and detriments of making certain of our products available on a free basis. while we do not receive any revenue from our free customers, we bear incremental expenses and other liabilities as a result of our free customers’ continuing free use of our network and certain of our products. adverse political, business, and reputational consequences associated with internet properties we serve that are perceived as hostile, offensive, or inappropriate may also be disproportionately common among our free customers. the vast majority of our customers do not pay for our products. in addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future. we face intense and increasing competition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the markets for our network and products are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, and frequent introductions of new, and improvements of, existing products. our broad portfolio of products exposes us to competition from a large number of competitors in a number of different markets, including companies and their product and services offerings in, among others, virtual private networks, internal and external firewalls, web security (including web application firewalls and content filtering), distributed denial-of-service (ddos) prevention, intrusion detection and prevention, application delivery controls, content delivery networks, domain name systems, email security vendors, advanced threat prevention, and wide area network (wan) technology. our competitors provide both on-premises, appliance-based solutions, and cloud-based services that have functionality similar to our network and products. we expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies and start-ups enter the markets for products and solutions for security, performance, and reliability, in particular with respect to cloud-based solutions, as customer requirements evolve and as new products, services, and technologies are introduced. if we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or our growth rate that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. our potential competitors include large companies with substantial infrastructure, such as global telecommunications services provider partners and public cloud providers. these companies could choose to enter the markets for products and solutions for security, performance, and reliability, including by acquiring existing companies, developing their own internal solutions, or establishing cooperative relationships with businesses that may allow them to offer more comprehensive solutions or to offer solutions for lower prices or to adapt more quickly than us to new technologies and customer needs. as our business continues to grow and we increase our market share for various products and services, these larger companies may increase their focus on us as a competitor and the actions they undertake to compete with our business and products. additionally, if an increasing portion of web content is housed on another company’s network or portions of the internet are otherwise privatized, it could reduce the demand for our products and increase competitive pressure on us. these competitive pressures in our markets or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer subscriptions, reduced revenue and gross margin, increased net losses, and loss of market share. our current competitors include a number of different types of companies, including:  on-premises network hardware vendors;  point solution vendors, which provide cloud-based products and services to address a single use case or challenge, in various categories including cloud security vendors, content delivery network (cdn) vendors, domain name system (dns) services vendors, email security vendors, and cloud sd-wan vendors; and  traditional public cloud vendors. many of our existing and potential competitors have or could have substantial competitive advantages including, among others:  greater name recognition;  longer operating histories;   larger customer bases;  larger sales and marketing budgets and capital resources;  broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and customers;  greater customer support resources;  greater resources to make acquisitions and enter into strategic partnerships;  lower labor and research and development costs;  more mature products and services developed for large customers;  larger and more mature intellectual property rights portfolios;  control of significant technologies, standards, or networks, including operating systems, with which our products must interoperate;  higher or more difficult to obtain security certifications than we possess; and  substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. in addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings, which may allow them to leverage existing commercial relationships, incorporate functionality into existing products, sell products and services with which we compete at zero or negative margins, offer fee waivers and reductions or other economic and non-economic concessions, bundle products and solutions, maintain closed technology platforms, or render our products unable to interoperate with such platforms. if they were to engage in predatory competitive practices, it could harm our existing product offerings or prevent us from creating viable products in other segments of the markets in which we participate. if our competitors are able to exploit their advantages or are able to persuade our customers or potential customers that their products are superior to ours, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially affected. if we do not effectively attract, train, and retain our sales force to be able to sell our existing and new products and product features, we may be unable to add new contracted customers, or increase sales to our existing customers and our business would be adversely affected. a substantial majority of our revenue in the year ended december 31, 2023 was from contracted customers that were acquired through our inside and field sales teams, and we expect our sales teams to continue generating the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. as a result, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to effectively attract, train, and retain qualified sales personnel, including senior sales leaders, and the ability of our dedicated sales personnel to acquire new contracted customers and expand our relationships with our existing contracted customers. our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective contracted customers. increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our network and products will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to expand and further invest in our sales and marketing operations and activities. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. we believe that selling subscriptions to our products requires particularly talented sales personnel that understand a very wide array of highly technical topics, including significant portions of global networking, internet, enterprise and identity security, and application development for both on-premises and cloud requirements. in addition, as we continue to develop and sell newer types of products and product features, such as our cloudflare one suite of solutions and our developer suite of products, we will need our sales personnel to be proficient in selling both these newer products and features and our overall broader suite of products to our existing and potential customers. changes in the senior leadership of our sales team, such as the departure of our former president of revenue and the hiring of our new president of revenue in february 2024, also could negatively impact our ability to retain current members of our sales team. if we are unable to effectively attract, train, and retain qualified sales personnel, particularly as our lines of products and product features expand, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be adversely impacted. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future also will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of these talented sales personnel in both the united states and  international markets. in addition, our ability to effectively recruit and retain qualified sales personnel outside the united states is reduced if we do not have a local subsidiary and office in that country or, if we do have such a subsidiary and office, we will experience increased costs in operating in that country. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence in the countries in which we currently operate, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity or that may be recovered on a more delayed basis than expected. as we continue to focus on revenue growth, we are seeking to increase our rate of hiring sales personnel and any delays in making these incremental sales hires could have an adverse impact on our ability to increase revenue, particularly with respect to our sales to contracted customers. in addition, if we fail to effectively train and integrate new hires, it could negatively impact the existing sales and marketing personnel and their productivity, relationships with our customers, our ability to generate a pipeline of new customers, and our ability to increase revenue.  new sales hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. as a result, our new sales hires and planned sales hires may not become as productive as we would like or as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. in addition, due to our rapid growth, a large percentage of our sales team is new to our company and inexperienced in selling subscriptions to our products, and therefore these personnel may be less effective than our more seasoned employees. for example, beginning in late 2022 and continuing through the end of the first quarter of 2023, we experienced a reduction in average productivity among our sales personnel, which we believe was due in part to new sales hires not becoming as productive as we expected and exacerbated by worsening macroeconomic conditions. while we continue to address productivity and focus on hiring, training, and retaining successful sales personnel, these efforts may take longer than anticipated, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our targeted revenue growth. in addition, experienced sales personnel are particularly sought after in our industry and we believe our company's recent growth and increased profile may result in increased efforts by other companies to hire our sales personnel. as a result, we may have to expend significant resources to retain our most productive sales employees. even with considerable effort, we may be unsuccessful at retaining our experienced sales employees, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we cannot predict whether, or when or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. if we are unable to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business and future growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected. if we fail to effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high-quality levels of customer support, ensure the reliability and security of our network, adequately address competitive challenges, or maintain our corporate culture, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed. we have experienced, and may in the future experience, periods of rapid growth. for example, our headcount grew from 2,439 employees as of december 31, 2021, to 3,217 employees as of december 31, 2022, to 3,682 employees as of december 31, 2023. we also have expanded the locations where we have employees to a number of new locations around the world during the past several years. the number of customers, users, and requests on our network also has increased rapidly in recent years. while we expect to continue to expand our operations, network, and products significantly in the future, both domestically and internationally, our growth may not be sustainable. our growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively, which will require that we continue to improve our administrative, operational, financial, and management systems and controls by, among other things:  effectively attracting, training, and integrating a large number of new employees, particularly members of our sales, marketing, engineering, and management teams;  effectively managing a rapidly increasing number of employees in a growing number of countries around the world, particularly in circumstances when employees are working completely remotely;  ensuring the integrity and security of our network and it infrastructure throughout the world;  maintaining our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, and an emphasis on customer-focused results and contributes to our cost-effective business model;  successfully acquiring and integrating companies and assets to improve, expand, and diversify our business and products through strategic acquisitions, investments, and partnerships;  further improving our key business applications, processes, and it infrastructure, including our network co-location facilities, to support our current and anticipated business needs;  enhancing our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners, customers, and users;  maintaining high levels of customer support; and  appropriately documenting and testing our it systems and business processes. managing our growth will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. if we fail to manage our expected growth, the uninterrupted and secure operation of our network and products and key business systems, our corporate culture, our compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to our operations, the quality of our products, and our ability to compete could suffer. any failure to preserve our culture also could further harm our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and create new products, operate effectively, and execute on our business strategy. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross margin, operating margin, profitability, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue, and backlog, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the trading price of our class a common stock. factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include:  our ability to attract new paying customers, especially large customers, and, to a lesser extent, convert free customers to paying customers;  our ability to retain and upgrade paying customers and expand the number of products sold to paying customers, especially our large customers;  the timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;  the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure, as well as entry into operating and capital leases and co-location, interconnection, and similar agreements related to the expansion of our network;  the timing of expenses related to acquisitions;  any large indemnification payments to our customers or other third parties;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  the timing and success of new products, product features and service introductions by us or our competitors;  network outages or actual or perceived security breaches or incidents;  our involvement in litigation or regulatory enforcement efforts, or the threat thereof;  changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors and the emergence of new competitors;  increases in length of the sales cycle for our contracted customers, particularly as the relative proportion of our revenue from large customers increases and as the sizes of our large customers increase;  changes in laws and regulations that impact our business; and  general political, regulatory, economic, market, and social conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of financial institutions, other adverse changes in global and regional macroeconomic conditions, and other impacts of the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, or other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions. we rely on our co-founders and other key technical, sales, and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to successfully attract, integrate, and retain qualified senior management and other personnel, or the failure of new members of our management team to successfully lead and scale our business, could harm our business. our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, integrate, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of our co-founders, matthew prince, our chief executive officer, and michelle zatlyn, our president and chief operating officer. we rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support, research and development, and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team. although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. we also do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. from time to time, there may be changes in our management team as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of our senior management and other key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. additionally, as our business grows in scale and complexity, other changes to our management team may be necessary. for example, during 2023, we hired several new members of our senior management team, including our senior vice president, engineering; senior vice president, chief security officer; and senior vice president, chief people officer, and our chief product officer left the company. in addition, in february 2024, our former president of revenue departed and we hired our new president of revenue. any significant leadership change or senior management transition, such as these, involves inherent risks and any failure to ensure timely and suitable replacements and smooth transitions could hinder our strategic planning, business execution, and future performance. in particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with existing employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. we must successfully integrate our new leadership team members within our organization to achieve our operating objectives. if we lose one or more of our senior management or other key employees and are unable to find adequate replacements, or if we fail to successfully attract, integrate, retain and motivate members of our senior management team and key employees, our business could be harmed. to execute our growth plan, we must also attract and retain large numbers of highly qualified personnel in a number of job markets globally. in particular, it is critical for us to attract and retain sales and engineering talent in our fast growing industry. competition for these personnel in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters is located, and in lisbon, london, singapore, austin, texas, and other locations where we employ personnel, is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications. we have from time to time experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications or level of experience. for example, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulty recruiting, hiring, and retaining sales personnel with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge necessary to effectively sell our products to large customers. additionally, in recent years, recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of high-profile cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and may provide higher levels of compensation or more attractive benefits. we may need to increase our existing compensation levels in response to competition, rising inflation, or labor shortages, which may increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. volatility or lack of performance in our stock price has in the past, and may in the future, affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees or require us to increase the number of shares that we include in employee equity awards, which has and may continue to affect our outstanding share count, cause dilution to existing shareholders, and increase our stock-based compensation expense. in addition, upon vesting of equity  awards, many of our employees have acquired or may soon acquire a substantial amount of personal wealth. this may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. any failure to successfully attract, integrate, or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we believe our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus on growth, which may negatively impact our profitability. a significant part of our business strategy is to focus on long-term growth and to reinvest our cash flow from operations into our business, including the expansion of our global network, the development of new products and features, the expansion of our global workforce, and the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. for example, in the year ended december 31, 2023, we increased our operating expenses to $1,175.2 million as compared to $943.8 million and $637.0 million in the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. in the year ended december 31, 2023 we decreased our net loss to $183.9 million as compared to $193.4 million and $260.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. as a result, we may continue to operate at a loss or our profitability may be lower than it would be if our strategy were to maximize short-term profitability. significant expenditures on sales and marketing efforts, and expenditures on growing our network and expanding our research and development and portfolio of products, each of which we intend to continue to invest in, may not ultimately grow our business or cause long-term profitability. if we are ultimately unable to achieve or improve profitability at the level or during the time frame anticipated by industry or financial analysts and our stockholders, our stock price may decline. if we are not able to maintain and promote our brand, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a provider of products with the highest levels of security, performance, and reliability is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and our ability to attract new customers. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including the reliability of our network on which we provide our products and the record of security, performance, and reliability of our products; the timing of releases of our products and related features after the public announcement of such expected products and features; our marketing efforts; our ability to continue to develop high-quality features and products for our network; and our ability to successfully differentiate our products from competitive products and services. our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. independent industry and financial analysts often provide reviews of our products, as well as those of our competitors. perception of our offerings in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these expert reviews. in addition, the difficulty or inability of us to periodically provide certain types of financial information about our business and products requested by industry analysts could adversely impact these analysts’ reviews of our products. if reviews of our products are negative, or less positive than those of our competitors’, our brand may be adversely affected. the performance of our channel partners also may affect our brand and reputation, particularly if customers do not have a positive experience with our channel partners. the promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets and products. expenditures intended to maintain and enhance our brand may not be cost-effective or effective at all. if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, we may have reduced pricing power relative to our competitors, we could lose customers, or we could fail to attract potential new customers or expand sales to our existing customers, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we have limited experience with some of our pricing models, particularly for our newer products and solutions as well as bundled sales of our products and solutions, and we may not accurately predict the long-term rate of paying customer adoption or renewal, or the impact these will have on our revenue or results of operations. we generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our products. we offer subscription plans that provide varying degrees of functionality, and also offer separate subscriptions to various add-on products and network functionality. we have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and pricing models for some of our newer subscription plans and products, as well as our bundled sales of products and solutions and our recently-introduced  professional services to assist some of our large customers in their migration from existing vendors and otherwise with the configuration and use of our products. as the markets for our products mature, as we enter into newer product markets for our business, as we shift the way in which we sell our products and solutions, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. moreover, our increasing focus on larger customers may lead to greater price concessions in the future or have a more significant impact period to period on our revenue and results of operations. as a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial condition, and cash flow. we also have limited experience in determining which products and functionality to offer as part of our subscription plans, which to offer as add-on products, and which related products to sell in bundles. our limited experience in determining the optimal manner in which to bundle and price our various products and functionalities could reduce our ability to capture the value delivered by our offerings, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, and if we fail to continue to expand, grow, and retain these relationships then our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely impacted. to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with third parties, such as value-added channel partners, referral partners, systems integrators, global platform providers, telecommunications companies, and managed security service providers. developing, expanding, and retaining these strategic relationships has played, and will continue to play, an increasingly greater role in our sales efforts, especially with our large customers. however, identifying these types of strategic partners, negotiating and documenting our business and contractual relationships with them, maintaining application programming interfaces (apis) that some of our strategic partners use to interact with our business, and monitoring the actions of our channel partners and their relationships with our end customers, each require significant time and resources. while in some cases our contractual arrangements with our strategic partners have terms of one year or longer, in many cases these arrangements are short-term in nature and can be terminated on 90 days advance notice. our competitors also may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services over subscriptions to our products. in addition, acquisitions of such strategic partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as these partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications by potential customers or may seek to terminate their relationships with us. further, some of our partners are or may become competitive with certain of our products and may elect to no longer integrate with our network and products. if we are unsuccessful in establishing, expanding, or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer. even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our products by, or increased revenue from, our paying customers and large customers. our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support. failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition. we believe that the successful adoption and usage of our network and products requires a high level of support and engagement for many of our customers, particularly our large customers. in order to deliver appropriate customer support and engagement, we must successfully assist our customers in deploying and continuing to use our network and products, migrating from their existing vendors, resolving performance issues, addressing interoperability challenges with the customers’ existing it infrastructure, and responding to security threats and cyber attacks and performance and reliability problems that may arise from time to time. the it architecture of our contracted customers, particularly the larger organizations, is very complex and may require high levels of focused technical support to effectively migrate from each customer's existing vendors and to utilize our network and products. because our network and products are designed to be highly configurable and to rapidly implement customers’ reconfigurations, customer errors in configuring our network and products can result in significant disruption to our customers. our support organization faces additional challenges associated with large customers in highly regulated industries, as well as our international operations, including those associated with delivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than english. increased demand for customer support,  without corresponding increases in revenue, could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, we have recently begun providing professional services to assist some of our large customers in their migration from existing vendors and otherwise with the configuration and use of our products. we do not have significant experience in providing professional services or determining the pricing for such services, and our failure to provide such services effectively or at pricing that appropriately reflects our costs of providing such services could negatively impact our customer satisfaction and retention and our results of operations. we also rely on channel partners in order to provide migration assistance and frontline support to some of our customers, including in regions where we do not have a significant physical presence or the customers primarily speak languages other than english. if our channel partners do not provide assistance and support to the satisfaction of our customers, we may lose these customers, such customers may reduce their usage of our products, or we may be required to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources in order to provide an adequate level of assistance and support, generally at a higher cost than that associated with our channel partners. there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire sufficient support personnel as and when needed, particularly if our sales exceed our internal forecasts. to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide high-quality and timely support to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction with our network and products could be adversely affected. any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly with respect to our large customers. our business depends, in part, on sales to the united states and foreign government organizations, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. we derive a portion of our revenue from contracts with government organizations, and we believe the success and growth of our business will in part depend on adding additional public sector customers. however, demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the public sector. sales to government entities are subject to substantial additional risks that are not present in sales to other customers, including:  selling to government agencies can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than sales to other customers, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;  increasing numbers of u.s., european, or other government certification and audit requirements potentially applicable to our network, including fedramp in the united states, are often difficult and costly to obtain and maintain, and failure to do so will restrict our ability to sell to government customers in the applicable jurisdictions;  government demand, payment for, and continued usage of, our products may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, funding authorizations, or government shutdowns;  governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in fines, civil or criminal liability, further investigations, damage to our reputation, and debarment from further government business;  governments often require contract terms that differ from our standard customer arrangements, including terms that can lead to those customers obtaining broader rights in our products than would be expected under a standard commercial contract and terms that can allow for early termination;   governments may require us to partner with companies based in the governments’ jurisdictions in order for us to sell any of our products to those governments, which could result in a loss of revenue we otherwise would receive for such sales; and  governments may demand better pricing terms and public disclosure of such pricing terms, which may harm our ability to negotiate pricing terms with our non-government customers. in addition, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with the public sector, including u.s. federal, state, and local governmental organizations, as well as foreign governmental organizations, which affect how we and our channel partners do business with governmental  agencies. selling our products to the u.s. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including expanded compliance obligations under the federal acquisition regulations (fars). failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for example, the u.s. department of justice (doj) and the general services administration (gsa) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with vendors under the false claims act and other statutes related to misrepresenting cybersecurity practices or protocols, pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts. the doj and gsa continue to actively pursue such claims. violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. any inability to address these risks and challenges could reduce the commercial benefit to us or otherwise preclude us from selling subscriptions to our products to government organizations. we rely on third-party software for certain essential financial and operational services, and a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. we rely on third-party software to provide many essential financial and operational services to support our business, including netsuite, salesforce, atlassian, stripe, and workday among others. many of these vendors are less established and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. moreover, these vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. as a result, we depend upon these vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes. any failure by these vendors to do so, or any disruption in our ability to access the internet, would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our operations. our business is exposed to risks associated with credit card and other online payment processing methods. many of our customers pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, and online payment applications and wallets. we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payments. acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, loss of payment partners, and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses, and results of operation could be adversely impacted. in addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and our card approval rate may be impacted. if we fail to comply with the rules or requirements applicable to processing payments, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, or otherwise unable to detect or prevent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept certain payments from our customers. the termination of our ability to process payments using any major payment method our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our products over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to discern. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the term of their subscription, which in the case of our contracted customers typically range from one to three years and in the case of our pay-as-you-go customers is typically monthly. consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals to these customers in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, may affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we may also be unable to  reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. by contrast, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, which occurs as soon as a customer starts using our network and products. as a result, an increase in customers could result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier portion of the subscription term. we may not attain sufficient revenue to maintain positive cash flow from operations or achieve profitability in any given period. if our estimates, assumptions, or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s. gaap) requires our management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred contract acquisitions costs, the period of benefit generated from our deferred contract acquisition costs, the capitalization and estimated useful life of internal-use software, valuation of acquired intangible assets, the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, useful lives of property and equipment, the determination of the incremental borrowing rate used for operating lease liabilities, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, uncertain tax positions, and the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. due to geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including but not limited to the ongoing conflicts between hamas and israel and between russia and ukraine, and other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, inflationary pressures, and changes in interest rates, there is ongoing uncertainty and significant disruption in the global economy and financial markets. we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of february 21, 2024, the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10-k. these estimates and assumptions may change in the future, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, or changes to existing standards, and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and profit and loss, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit and loss target, which may negatively impact our results of operations. future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. part of our business strategy is to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. to date, our acquisitions typically have consisted of companies that have developed technology that is complementary to our business but have small numbers of employees and little, if any, customers and revenue. we have limited experience in making acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company, particularly companies with large numbers of employees and customers. however, we expect the number of acquisitions that we undertake to increase and some of the businesses we acquire will have significantly larger numbers of employees and  customers and more global operations. for example, in april 2022, we acquired area 1 security, inc., a company that has developed cloud-native email security technology and has a significantly greater number of employees and customers than our prior acquisitions. in addition, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we identify companies that we would like to buy, we may also face antitrust, competition, and other regulatory scrutiny that may limit our ability to complete such acquisitions. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by customers, developers, or investors. in addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. if we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions, or integrate and retain the people, technologies or customers associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process in connection with an acquisition will require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management, and disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we also frequently provide significant incentives for key employees of acquired companies to remain as our employees after the completion of the acquisition in order to facilitate integration and allow us to achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition, but these incentives may not prove to be successful in retaining those new key employees. in addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. in order to expand our network and product offerings, we also may enter into relationships with other businesses, which could involve joint ventures, preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, or investments in other companies. negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and costly, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control. consequently, we cannot assure you that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close or will lead to commercial benefit for us. in connection with the foregoing strategic transactions, we may:  issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;  use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;  incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;  incur large charges or substantial actual or contingent liabilities associated with acquired businesses;  encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures and retaining employees and customers of acquired companies; and  become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges. these challenges related to acquisitions or other strategic transactions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. certain of our key business metrics could prove to be inaccurate, and any real or perceived inaccuracies may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. we rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key business metrics, such as dollar-based net retention rate. we regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our key business metrics to improve their accuracy. our key business metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or we may discover inaccuracies in our process for calculating such metrics. for example, during the quarter ended march 31, 2022, we experienced a system error that caused the calculation of our paying customers for such quarter to be overstated by 5,925 pay-as-you-go customers. if investors or analysts do not perceive our key business metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our key business metrics, our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed. we may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity and equity-linked securities as well as payments received from customers using our global cloud network and products. for example, we received substantial proceeds from the issuance and sale of our class a common stock in our initial public offering (ipo) and in the issuances and sales of our 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 notes) and 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes, and together with the 2025 notes, the notes). although we currently anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, we may require additional financing. we evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. for example, volatility in equity capital markets has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect market prices of our shares of class a common stock. this may materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our business through the sale of our equity and equity-linked securities if such funding were to become necessary. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock, and, in the case of equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution."
NET,"risks related to our network and products we may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes or develop new products and product features that are attractive to, and that contain all of the capabilities required by, our current and prospective future customers, especially large customers. the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, including frequent introductions of new products and services, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and the development of novel cyber attacks by hostile parties, as well as changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences. our need for continuous innovation is driven not only by competitive forces within our industry but also by our need to out-innovate the highly motivated third parties seeking to breach or compromise our network and those of our customers for economic, political, military, or other purposes. our ability to attract new customers and retain, and increase, revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to these forces on a timely basis and continue to introduce enhancements to our network and existing products and develop new products that have the features, and that function with the security, performance, and reliability capabilities, demanded by our customers, especially our large customers. if new technologies or advancements in technologies emerge that deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, more securely or reliably, or are higher performing, these technologies or advancements could render our network and existing products less attractive to our current and prospective future customers, or obsolete. for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning may change the way our industry identifies and responds to cyber threats, and businesses that are slow to adopt or fail to adopt these new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. the development of novel attacks or exploits by criminal or malicious elements or hostile state actors also could render our network and existing products less effective or obsolete. if we are unable to develop new products and enhance our existing products so that they have the features and capabilities required by existing and potential new customers, especially large customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.  the success of our business also depends on our continued investment in our research and development organization to increase the integrity, reliability, availability, and scalability of our products. we may experience difficulties with development, design, or marketing of such enhancements to our network and products that could delay or prevent their development, introduction, or implementation. for example, in the past we have announced the development of new products and features or the release of new products or features for beta testing and the timing for the general release of the product or feature has been substantially later than we initially expected. we also have in the past experienced delays in the planned expansion of our network and in our internally planned or publicly announced release dates of new products and new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that planned expansions of our network will occur on schedule and that new products, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule or, when released, will function fully as expected. any such delays could result in adverse publicity or brand reputation, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by"
NET,"customers brought against us, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. problems with our internal systems, networks, or data, including actual or perceived breaches or failures, could cause our network or products to be perceived as insecure, underperforming, or unreliable, our customers to lose trust in our network and products, our reputation to be damaged, and our financial results to be negatively impacted. we face security threats from malicious third parties that could obtain unauthorized access to our internal systems, networks, and data, including the equipment at our network and core co-location facilities. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate the risk of these security threats and the security, performance, and reliability of our network and products has been in the past, and may be in the future, disrupted by third parties, including nation-states, competitors, hackers, disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors. for example, in november 2023, we detected that a likely nation-state threat actor had gained unauthorized access to one of our internal systems. while we immediately began investigating the intrusion and believe we cut off the threat actor’s access prior to significant impact on our customer data or systems, we expect we will continue to be subject to similar threats of unauthorized access in the future and we may not be as successful in quickly identifying such intrusions and mitigating the impacts of such intrusions. we also face the possibility of security threats from other sources, such as employee or contractor errors (such as errors in utilizing artificial intelligence or machine learning in our products or in the operation of our business) or malfeasance. for example, hostile third parties, including nation-states, may seek to bribe, extort, or otherwise manipulate our employees or contractors to compromise our network and products. in addition, as our business grows and we employ more employees and engage more contractors in more countries around the world, our ability to supervise the actions of our employees and contractors will decrease and the risk of an employee or contractor error or act of malfeasance will increase. these security threats from third parties are also likely to increase as the numbers, sizes, and types of customers using our network and products increases, particularly our customers that are involved in particularly sensitive industries or activities, such as banking and finance companies and governmental entities or in relation to elections in the united states or elsewhere. additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning may increase cybersecurity risks we face through, for example, being used to increase the prevalence or intensity of cyber attacks. while we have implemented security measures internally and have integrated security measures into our network and products, these measures have not always functioned as expected and have not always detected or prevented all unauthorized activity, prevented all security breaches or incidents, mitigated all security breaches or incidents, or protected against all attacks or incidents and these types of security failures could occur again in the future. for example, we have experienced multiple social engineering attacks where third parties have attempted, and in limited cases succeeded, in breaching our network perimeter security. while these attacks did not effectively get beyond our network perimeter security and we have not suffered any material consequences as a result of these breaches, we cannot be certain that future breaches will be avoided or, if future breaches are successful, that we will not experience material detrimental impacts, particularly if those breaches involve third party access to decrypted or other sensitive data. in addition, there is risk that the vendors we use may be attacked and the controls we have in place are bypassed and our data accessed as a result. for example, one of the it tools our employees used internally until the first quarter of 2023 was the subject of a large security incident in december 2022, which resulted in unauthorized parties stealing large amounts of the it tools' customers’ data, including our data. we are not aware of any of our systems having been compromised as a result of this security incident due to additional required authorization and authentication events we have in place, particularly when accessing sensitive systems and resources, and we have since changed to using a new it tool internally. in addition, in march 2022 and october 2023, breaches of the systems of our identity access management vendor resulted in attacks on our systems. while we quickly discovered these resulting attacks on our systems and believed we had fully contained their impact on our systems and data, the october 2023 breach of our systems contributed to the november 2023 intrusion of our systems by a likely nation-state threat actor. while none of these incidents had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, we cannot be certain that compromises of our systems will not happen in the future as a result of these incidents or other similar incidents with third party vendors that we use to help secure our internal systems and that such incidents will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, among other things, changes to our internal systems, remediating or replacing equipment within our global network, implementing additional threat protection measures, making modifications to our products and our global network, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with credits under our agreements with them or other incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking  other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. because these threats are constantly evolving, we believe successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures will become increasingly challenging. the global network that we use to provide our products to our customers is made up of equipment at co-location facilities located in more than 310 cities and over 120 countries worldwide and we expect to continue to increase the size of our network in the future. as we grow the size and scope of our network, the number of our employees and third party contractors that have access to our equipment at these facilities will continue to increase, which will also increase the risk of potential errors or malfeasance such as potential equipment theft or potential attempts to interfere with, or intercept, network and customer data that is held in, or flows through, this equipment. in addition, local government officials may attempt to, or successfully take control of, our equipment in an attempt to interfere with our services or intercept data. because the equipment in our network co-location facilities is designed to run all of our products, any insertion of ransomware or other malicious code on, unauthorized access to, or other security breach or incident with respect to, any of this equipment at any of these locations around the world could potentially impact all of our products running on this equipment around the world. we may also experience security breaches and other incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, may have a greater impact on our products and the networks and systems used in our business, the proprietary and other confidential data contained on our network or otherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately our business. we expect to incur significant costs in our efforts to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, and we have in the past faced, including in connection with the november 2023 intrusion of our systems, and may in the future face, increased costs in the event of actual or perceived security breaches or other security-related incidents. our internal systems are exposed to the same cybersecurity risks and consequences of a breach as the systems of our customers and other enterprises, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or reputation. these cybersecurity risks pose a particularly significant risk to a business like ours that is focused on providing highly secure products to customers. with the increase in remote work during recent years, we and our customers face increased risks to the security of infrastructure and data, and geopolitical tensions or events such as the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts also may increase these risks. we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches or incidents. we also may face increased costs relating to maintaining and securing our infrastructure and data that we maintain and otherwise process. there can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented or that are included in the equipment and related third-party software that we use to operate our global network will be effective against current or future security threats. we also cannot guarantee that our systems and networks or those of our third-party service providers or the equipment and related third-party software that we use to operate our global network have not been breached or otherwise compromised, or that they and any software in our or their supply chains do not contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or compromised code that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. unauthorized access to, other security breaches of, or security incidents affecting, systems, networks, equipment, and data used in our business, including those of our vendors, contractors, or those with which we have strategic relationships, even if not resulting in an actual or perceived introduction of ransomware, malware, or other malicious code or other actual or perceived breach of our customers’ networks, systems, or data, could result in the loss, compromise, corruption or other unavailability of data, disruptions to our and our customers' products, systems, networks, and operations, loss of business, reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, significant costs for remediation, and other liabilities. additionally, even in the absence of malicious actions, our network and products may experience errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs that cause our products not to perform as intended and the likelihood of these problems may increase as we continue to expand the number and complexity of our products and related features, through artificial intelligence or otherwise, that we offer to our customers through our global network. for example, from time to time we are subject to “route leaks” that involve the accidental or, less commonly, illegitimate advertisement of prefixes, or blocks of ip addresses, which propagate across networks such as ours and can lead to incorrect routing of traffic across our network, taking traffic offline, or in extreme cases, potential interception of customers’ traffic by attackers. for example, in june 2019, a route leak spread by a major telecommunications services provider caused significant disruption to our traffic and that of many other providers. although events like this are outside our control, they could materially harm our reputation and diminish the confidence of our current and potential customers in our network and products. deployment of our network and products into other computing environments may expose these errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products. in addition, any such errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may not be found until after they are deployed to our customers and may create the perception that our  network and products are insecure, underperforming, or unreliable. for example, we have experienced a limited number of network outages over the past five years due to a variety of causes.  while the june 2019 route leak and the network outages did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, any similar events that may occur in the future may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. in addition, in the event network outages or similar events occur, these events can require additional capital expenditures to lessen the chance that similar events will occur in the future.  we also provide frequent updates and enhancements to our network and products, which increase the possibility of errors. our quality assurance procedures and efforts to report, track, and monitor issues with our network has not always been sufficient to ensure we detect any such defects in a timely manner. for example, in the past we have made errors that have contributed to outages on our global network or to the leak of customer data. there can be no assurance that our software code is or will remain free from actual or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs, or that we will accurately route or process all requests and traffic on our network. given the trillions of internet requests that route through our network on a monthly basis and the large array of internet properties (e.g., domains, websites, apis, and mobile applications) we service, the impact of any such error, failure, vulnerability, or bug can be large in terms of absolute numbers of affected requests and customers. actual or perceived problems with our network or systems, or those of our vendors, contractors, or those with which we have strategic relationships, could result in actual or perceived breaches of our or our customers’ networks and systems or data and/or subject us to reputational or financial harm. we are also required to comply with complex and evolving laws, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, including regarding our notifications to government agencies or public disclosures with respect to actual or perceived cybersecurity or personal data breaches, or other cybersecurity incidents, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm or lead to claims and litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory reporting and/or audits, proceedings, and investigations and significant legal fees, significant costs for remediation, the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual or perceived security breach or incident. our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions.  actual or perceived breaches or other security incidents could also damage our relationships with our existing customers and have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers. because our business is focused on providing secure and high performing network services to our customers, we believe that our products and the networks and systems we use in our business could be targets for hackers and others, and that an actual or perceived breach of, or security incident affecting, our networks, systems, or data, could be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer and channel partner confidence in our solution, and our business. additionally, our products are designed to operate without interruption, including up to a 100% uptime guarantee for our business and enterprise plans. if a breach or security incident were to impact the availability of our network and products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our reputation, could be adversely affected. any cybersecurity insurance that we carry may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by us in connection with any privacy or cybersecurity incidents or may not cover the kinds of incidents for which we submit claims. for example, insurers may consider cyber attacks by a nation-state as an “act of war” and any associated damages as uninsured. we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our reputation. if our global network that delivers our products or the core co-location facilities we use to operate our network are damaged, interfered with, or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of our business or local regulations, our ability to provide access to our network and products to our customers and maintain the  performance of our network could be negatively impacted, which could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer. as of december 31, 2023, we hosted our global network and served our customers from co-location and internet service provider (isp) partner facilities located in more than 310 cities and over 120 countries worldwide. in addition to these global facilities, much of the infrastructure for our global network and for our business and operations is maintained through a core co-location facility located in the greater portland, oregon area, a second core co-location facility located in luxembourg that provides certain redundancy to the u.s. core facility, and through a limited number of other u.s. co-location facilities that provide limited subsets of our network support. while we have electronic and, to a lesser extent, physical access to the components and infrastructure of our network and co-location facilities that are hosted by third parties — including isp-partner facilities — we do not control the operation of these third-party facilities. consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. all of our co-location and isp-partner facilities and network infrastructure are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including earthquakes; weather events; floods; fires; power loss; system failures; computer viruses; physical or electronic break-ins; human error; malfeasance; or interference, including by disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors; terrorism; and other catastrophic events. for example, in november 2023, our control plane and analytics services experienced an outage triggered by a power failure at one of our core data centers in the greater portland, oregon area, which impacted certain customers' access to some of our products and services for several days and the loss of certain customer logs. in addition, we have experienced a route leak and a limited number of network outages involving our core and network co-location facilities over the past five years due to a variety of causes. co-location facilities housing our network infrastructure may also be subject to local governmental or other administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, labor disputes, and litigation to stop, limit, or delay operations. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the co-location facilities without adequate notice, interference with, or sabotage of, our equipment at these facilities, or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in interruptions or delays in the availability of our network and products, impede our ability to scale our operations, or have other adverse impacts upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, errors or defects in our customers’ software can result in unexpected and unintentional upward spikes in their usage of our products and network, and those spikes can cause strains on, and adversely affect the availability and functioning of, our co-location facilities and our network. as we have expanded our global network, for efficiency reasons we have increased the amount of automation that is used to update and maintain our network. while we believe this increased automation generally makes our network more reliable and robust, if portions of this automation were to fail then the impact could apply to all or substantially all of our co-location facilities, instead of the more localized impact if we were not using automation. in addition, the components of our global network are interrelated, such that disruptions or outages affecting one or more of our network co-location facilities may increase the strain on other components of our network. concurrent disruptions or outages at one or more of our network co-location facilities may lead to a cascading effect in which heightened strain on our network causes further disruptions or outages, particularly within the regions where the disruptions and outages occur. in addition, the failure of any of our core co-location facilities for any significant period of time, particularly our u.s. core co-location facility, could place a significant strain upon the ongoing operation of our business, as we have only limited redundant functionality for these facilities. such a failure of a core co-location facility could degrade and slow down our network, reduce the functionality of our products for our customers, result in gaps or loss in customer analytics or functionality with respect to some of our products, impact our ability to bill our customers, result in the loss of customers or reduction in their purchases from us due to dissatisfaction with the reliability of our products and network, and otherwise materially and adversely impact our business, reputation, and results of operations. if our customers’ or partners’ access to our network and products is interrupted or delayed for any reason, our business could suffer. any interruption or delay in our customers’ or partners’ access to our network and products will negatively impact our customers. our customers depend on the continuous availability of our network for the delivery and use of our products, and our products are designed to operate without interruption, including up to 100% uptime guarantee for our business and enterprise plans. if all or a portion of our network were to fail, our customers and partners could lose access to their internal network and/or the internet as a whole until such disruption is resolved or they deploy disaster recovery options that allow them to bypass our network. the adverse effects of any network interruptions  on our reputation and financial condition may be heightened due to the nature of our business and our customers’ expectation of continuous and uninterrupted internet access and low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. in addition, because some of our customers’ most critical applications are protected by our products and network and these customers may not be using other providers for similar services, the adverse effect of network disruptions to these customers could be particularly severe. the impact of an interruption in access to our network and products could also impact the ability to run our own business because we use a number of our products in the operation of our business. while we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced a limited number of network outages over the past five years, and we may in the future experience network disruptions and other performance problems, in each case due to a variety of factors. the following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery, performance, and availability of our network and products:  the development, maintenance, and functioning of the infrastructure of the internet as a whole;  the performance and availability of third-party telecommunications services with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable internet access and services;  decisions by the owners and operators of the co-location and isp-partner facilities where our network infrastructure is deployed or by global telecommunications service provider partners who provide us with network bandwidth to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy, breach their contracts with us, or prioritize the traffic of other parties;  the occurrence of earthquakes, floods, weather events, fires, power loss, system failures, physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism (including the ongoing conflicts between hamas and israel and between russia and ukraine or potential consequence of geopolitical tensions in other areas of the world), human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors), and other catastrophic events;  cyber attacks targeted at us, facilities where our network infrastructure is located, our global telecommunications service provider partners, or the infrastructure of the internet;  errors, defects, or performance problems in the deployment, maintenance, and expansion of our network and products, including the software we use to operate our network and products and provide our related products to our customers;  our customers’ or partners’ improper deployment or configuration of our customers' access to our network and products;  the maintenance of the apis in our systems that our partners use to interact with us;  the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of the facilities hosting our network infrastructure, to redistribute load to other components of our network; and  the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. the occurrence of any of these factors, or our inability to efficiently and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively impact our relationship with our customers, or otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. abuse, misuse, or other unauthorized use of our internal network, including network services tools, could cause significant harm to our business and reputation. our employees and contractors use our internal network to support the operation of our global network and products for our customers. in addition, in order to provide real-time support to our customers, we have created internal network services tools that are used by our employees and contractors to diagnose and correct customer security, performance, and reliability issues. if any of our employees or contractors were to intentionally abuse our internal network, including these tools, by interfering with or altering our customers’ internet properties or systems, our customers could be significantly harmed. similarly, our customers could be harmed if government personnel in any countries in which our employees operate were to pressure our employees, including through the threat of potential prosecution or imprisonment, to use our internal network, including these tools, to access customer data or interfere with or alter our customers' internet properties or systems. our employees’ inadvertent misuse of our  internal network, including these tools, could similarly harm our customers. for example, third parties have in the past attempted to induce our employees to use their administrative access to reveal, remove, or disable our customers’ information and content, including by submitting fraudulent law enforcement requests, copyright takedown requests, or other content-based complaints. any such improper disclosure or removal could significantly and adversely impact our business and reputation. while our internal network and tools have been developed only for authorized use by our employees and contractors, any unauthorized use of, or access to, our internal network by, or release of network service tools to, third parties would represent a significant vulnerability in our products. accordingly, any abuse or misuse of our internal network and services tools could significantly harm our business and reputation. if it became necessary to further restrict the availability or use of our internal network and services tools by our employees and customers in response to any abuse or misuse, our ability to deliver high-quality and timely customer support could be harmed. detrimental changes in, or the termination of, any of our co-location relationships, isp partnerships, or our other interconnection relationships with isps could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our relationships with isp partners and other vendors that provide co-location services for our network infrastructure and the pricing and other material contract terms we have with these vendors are important for the maintenance, development, and expansion of our global network. if any of our co-location agreements were to expire or the pricing and other material terms of these agreements were to worsen, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected unless we were able to find a substitute vendor for the impacted facility on comparable or better terms. moreover, a significant number of our important co-location agreements are with a single company and if our arrangements with this company were to change in a manner adverse to us, we could face difficulty in maintaining or growing our network on commercially viable terms. in addition, as part of our arrangements with some of our isp partners, the isp partner has agreed to host our equipment for free or at a discount to the partner’s customary rate. there can be no assurances that these isp partners will continue to provide these types of favorable equipment hosting arrangements in the future. the efficient and effective operation of our network also relies upon a series of mutually beneficial arrangements with other internet infrastructure companies. these arrangements are often referred to as “peering” or “interconnection” agreements, and allow us and our isp partners to reduce bandwidth costs related to operating our respective networks. if the underlying competitive, business, or operational incentives supporting these arrangements were to change, we or our partners might terminate these agreements or allow them to expire. many of our peering or interconnection agreements have a term of three years or less, after which such agreements auto-renew on an annual basis. changes to the underlying incentive structure of peering arrangements may result from parties seeking to take advantage of an essential position or enter into exclusive arrangements, changes to u.s. or international laws, regulations, or policies, increasing competition between us and these internet infrastructure providers, or changes in the norms governing the relationships among internet infrastructure providers. without favorable peering arrangements, we would incur significantly increased costs to continue to provide our products at their current levels and such increased costs could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, to the extent that additional countries begin to regulate peering with outside networks, our costs may increase and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. if our network and products do not interoperate with our customers’ internal networks and infrastructure or with third-party products, websites, or services, our network may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed. our network and products must interoperate with our customers’ existing internal networks and infrastructure. these complex internal systems are developed, delivered, and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. as a result, the components of our customers’ infrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products, and may be highly customized. we must be able to interoperate and provide products to customers with highly complex and customized internal networks, which requires careful planning and execution between our customers, our customer support teams and, in some cases, our channel partners. further, when new or updated elements of our customers’ infrastructure or new technology or industry standards or protocols are introduced, we may have to update or enhance our network to allow us to continue to provide our products to customers. our competitors or other vendors may refuse to work with us to allow their products to interoperate with our network and products, which could make it difficult for our network and products to function properly in customer internal networks and infrastructures that include these third-party products. we may not deliver or maintain interoperability quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. these efforts require capital investment and engineering resources. if we fail to maintain compatibility of our network and products with our customers’ internal networks and infrastructures, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our network and products, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and number of customers and experience reduced demand for our products, which would materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. because we provide some of our products through a reverse-proxy, which is a network arrangement in which internet user requests initially are directed to our network’s servers rather than those of our customers, the source of some traffic may be difficult to ascertain. when they cannot identify the source of the traffic, some governments, third-party products, websites, or services may block our traffic or blacklist our ip addresses. if our customers experience significant instances of traffic blockages, they will experience reduced functionality or other inefficiencies, which would reduce customer satisfaction with our network and products and likelihood of renewal of their use of our products. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our network and any disruption in the availability of these components could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global network or replace defective equipment. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of the equipment we use to operate our network and provide products to our customers. our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over production costs and constraints based on the then current availability, terms, and pricing of these components. for example, we generally rely on a limited number of suppliers for the servers that we use in our network and we ordinarily purchase these components on a purchase-order basis, without any long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. while the network equipment and servers we purchase generally are commodity equipment and we believe an alternative supply source for servers on substantially similar terms could be identified quickly, our business could be adversely affected until those efforts are completed. in addition, the technology equipment industry has experienced component shortages and delivery delays in the past, and we may experience shortages or delays, including as a result of natural disasters, increased demand in the industry, or our suppliers lacking sufficient rights to supply the components in all jurisdictions in which we have co-location facilities that support our global network. for example, during 2021 and continuing through the first quarter of 2022, a global shortage of cpus, ram, ssds, and other electronics resulted in supply constraints for a number of electronics firms, including manufacturers of servers. this global shortage disrupted, and other shortages or similar supply constraints in the future may disrupt, some of our expected purchases of network equipment and servers. if our supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, there can be no assurance that additional supplies or components can serve as adequate replacements for the existing components or that supplies will be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. any disruption or delay in the supply of our hardware components may delay the opening of new co-location facilities, limit capacity expansion or replacement of defective or obsolete equipment at existing co-location facilities, or cause other constraints on our operations that could damage our customer relationships. the actual or perceived failure of our products to block malware or prevent a security breach or incident could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our security products are designed to reduce the threat to our customers posed by malware and other internet security threats. our security products may fail to detect or prevent malware or security breaches or incidents for any number of reasons. even where our security products perform as intended, the performance of our security products can be negatively impacted by our failure to enhance, expand, or update our network and products; improper classification of websites by our employees, automated systems, and partners which identify and track malicious websites; improper deployment or configuration of our products; the development, maintenance, and functioning of the infrastructure of the internet as a whole; and many other factors. for example, during august and september of 2023, an unknown threat actor exploited a vulnerability in the standard http/2 protocol critical to the function of the internet and websites. this threat actor worked to generate a series of the largest-scale ddos attacks against our network that we have recorded to date. while our systems were able to mitigate the overwhelming majority of incoming attacks, the volume overloaded some components in our network and impacted several customers’ performance, all of which were quickly resolved. during the process of mitigating these attacks, our team developed new technology to stop these types of attacks and further improve our own mitigations for this and other future attacks. although the impact of the attacks did not have a material impact on our reputation or  results of operations or financial condition, other future attacks like these may materially and adversely impact our reputation, results of operations or financial condition if we cannot effectively stop or mitigate the attacks and otherwise suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements and terms of service with our paying customers. companies are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, including traditional computer hackers; malicious code, such as viruses and worms; ddos attacks; sophisticated attacks conducted or sponsored by nation-states; advanced persistent threat intrusions; ransomware; phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering; employee, vendor, or contractor errors or malfeasance; and theft or misuse of intellectual property or business or personal data, including by disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors. external events, like the ongoing conflicts between hamas and israel and between russia and ukraine and other areas of geopolitical tension around the world and elections in the united states and elsewhere, can increase the likelihood of attacks. no security solution, including our products, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. accordingly, our security products may be unable to detect or prevent a threat until after our customers are impacted. as our products are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and by increasingly larger enterprises, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind cyber threats will focus on identifying ways to circumvent or defeat our security products. if our network is targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt it, it could create the perception that our security products are not capable of providing adequate security. as a provider of security products, any perceived lack of security to our network or any of our products could erode our customers’ and potential customers’ trust in our network and products. moreover, a high-profile security breach of, or security incident impacting, another cloud services provider could cause our customers and potential customers to lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and cloud-based products like ours in particular. any such loss of trust could materially and adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers. our customers must rely on complex network and security infrastructures, which include products and services from multiple vendors in addition to us, to secure their networks. if any of our customers becomes infected with malware, or experiences a security breach or incident, they could be disappointed with our products, regardless of whether our security products are intended to block the attack or would have blocked the attack if the customer had properly configured our products or their network, or taken other steps within their control. additionally, if any enterprises that are publicly known to use our network and products are the subject of a cyber attack that becomes publicized, this could harm our reputation and our current or potential customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our network and products. customers subject to cyber attack also may seek to hold us legally liable for any loss or lack of access to sensitive data or highly valued assets that results from such an attack. although our customer agreements provide significant limitations on our potential liability to our customers for such claims and we do not believe current legal theories would hold a service provider like us liable for such customers’ losses, potential adverse future changes in laws applicable to such claims could result in significant liabilities for us. from time to time, industry or financial analysts and research firms test our network and related security products against other security products. our products may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons, including misconfiguration. to the extent potential customers, industry or financial analysts, or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our products do not provide significant value or provide less value than competitive solutions, our reputation and business could be materially harmed. any real or perceived flaws in our network, or any actual or perceived security breaches of, or security incidents impacting, our customers, could result in:  a loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;  delayed or lost sales and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;  a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance of our products;  the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual or perceived security breach or incident;  negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand; and  legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages, and compensation to customers and business partners), litigation, regulatory audits, proceedings or investigations, and other liability. any of the above results could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may choose to make public disclosures in press releases, on our website and blog, through social media, and in other ways about our network, systems, products, and technology, which may include negative events, when we are not otherwise required by applicable law and those disclosures could materially and adversely impact our business, reputation, and results of operations. in the past we have been, and in the future we expect to be, transparent about our network, systems, products, and technology with our customers and the public in general. we believe that being rigorously and promptly transparent is an essential part of maintaining trust with our customers. at times, this transparency may result in us publicly disclosing information, including negative events, about our network, systems, products, and technology in circumstances where we may not be required to do so by applicable law. if and when we choose to make these types of non-legally required public disclosures, we may suffer reputational damage, loss of existing and potential new customers, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, significant costs for remediation, and other liabilities that could materially and adversely impact our business, reputation, and results of operations. in addition, we face increasing regulation requiring notifications to government agencies and/or public disclosures with respect to cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, privacy and data protection, and other incidents. if we do not believe the requirements of an applicable regulation have been triggered by an incident but we otherwise make a public disclosure about the incident, then one or more government regulators may seek additional information about the incidents or may allege that we failed to comply with our notification obligations to such agency or under applicable law. such allegations could result in harm to our reputation, distraction to our senior management team, potential investigations and fines, and loss of customers, or result in other liabilities or adverse consequences on our business. we provide service level commitments under our enterprise subscription plan customer contracts and our business subscription plan terms of service. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service or allow customers to terminate their subscriptions and our business could suffer. our enterprise subscription plan agreements and our business subscription plan terms of service typically provide for service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our network. in particular, our enterprise subscription plan and our business subscription plan terms of service include up to a 100% uptime guarantee. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could adversely impact the security, performance, and reliability of our network and products for our customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our network and products, these customers could seek to bring claims against us or terminate their agreements with us and, in the case of our contracted customers, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits that they may apply against future subscription fees otherwise owed to us, and, in certain cases, refunds of pre-paid and other fees. for example, a route leak and a limited number of network outages during the past five years triggered certain of these types of obligations. although the impact of the route leak and these outages did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, other future events like these may materially and adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. our revenue, other results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements and terms of service with our paying customers. if our products do not obtain and maintain market acceptance, our ability to grow our business and our results of operations may be adversely affected. our products are still evolving and it is difficult to predict customer demand and adoption rates for our product offerings. we believe that our network and cloud-based products represent a major shift from traditional solutions. many of our potential customers, particularly large enterprises and government entities, face barriers to adopting our offerings because of their prior investment in, and the familiarity of their it personnel with, on-premises,  appliance-based solutions or other providers of cloud-based solutions. as a result, our sales process often involves extensive efforts to educate our customers about our products, particularly as we continue to pursue customer relationships with large organizations. our customers also expect us to meet voluntary validations or adhere to industry standards and require our policies and practices to be evaluated by an independent third-party assessor. although we currently have certain certifications and reports such as soc2 type 2, pci dss, iso 27001, iso 27701, and iso 27018, c5, eu code of conduct, and fedramp moderate authorization, we may not be successful in continuing to maintain those certifications or in obtaining other certifications. in addition, sales to government entities and other large enterprises may in particular be conditioned upon adherence to pspc, ismap, irap, or dod il4 compliance in canada, japan, australia, and the united states, and we do not currently have these certifications. the costs of obtaining and maintaining certification pursuant to any of these standards are significant, and any failure to obtain and maintain such certifications for our network and products could reduce demand for them, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. to the extent our competitors have, and we do not have, these certifications, we may lose the opportunity to obtain subscriptions from certain potential paying customers. despite our efforts, we can provide no assurance that our cloud-based products will obtain market acceptance or that competing products or services based on other cloud-based and/or on-premises technologies will not achieve market acceptance. if we fail to achieve market acceptance of our products or are unable to keep pace with industry changes or obtain necessary product certifications, our ability to grow our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. in connection with our web3 suite of products and our potential future participation in various web3 protocol governance activities, we expect to hold certain types of cryptocurrency and similar types of digital assets that may be subject to unique regulatory and accounting risks, volatile market prices, and risks of loss, which could harm our business and reputation. the regulatory status of digital assets is subject to significant change. some or all of these assets are subject to significant regulatory restrictions and have even been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. if we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us based on these types of digital assets, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. the prices of digital assets have been and may continue to be highly volatile, including as a result of various associated risks, uncertainties and events. the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend, and their long-term adoption by investors, consumers, and businesses remains uncertain. for example, the bankruptcy of ftx trading ltd. in november 2022 undermined investor confidence in cryptocurrencies resulting in a decline in the price of cryptocurrency and similar types of digital assets. moreover, digital assets' lack of a physical form, their reliance on technology for their creation, existence, and transactional validation, and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence. in addition, if the market value of the digital assets we hold increases significantly relative to the purchase prices, we could be deemed an ""investment company"" for purposes of the investment company act of 1940, as amended, and may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements, restricting our activities in a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. moreover, digital assets are currently considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale, which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs. there is no guarantee that future changes in u.s. gaap will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us. further, digital assets have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyber attacks, or other malicious activities, including unauthorized access and theft, as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets. while we expect to implement appropriate security measures with respect to any future digital assets holdings, those measures may not function as expected and may not detect or prevent all unauthorized activity, prevent all security breaches or incidents, mitigate all security breaches or incidents, or protect against all attacks or incidents. if such threats are realized or the measures or controls that we create or implement to secure such assets fail, it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of such digital assets."
NET,"risks related to legal, tax, and regulatory matters activities of our paying and free customers or the content of their websites and other internet properties may violate applicable laws and/or our terms of service and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory enforcement actions, and/or liability in various jurisdictions. through our network, we provide a wide variety of products that enable our customers and our customers' users to exchange information, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. our customers and our customers' users may use our network and products in violation of applicable law or in violation of our terms of service or the customer’s own policies. the existing laws relating to the liability of providers of online products and services for activities of their users are highly unsettled and in flux both within the united states and internationally. we are currently, and in the future may be, subject to lawsuits and/or liability arising from the conduct of our customers and our customers' users. additionally, the conduct of our customers and our customers' users may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and/or liability. we are a defendant in lawsuits, both in the united states and abroad, seeking injunctive relief and/or damages against us based on content that is made available through our customers’ websites and other internet properties. a number of these lawsuits involve copyright infringement claims, and courts in italy and germany have at times directed us to take action by removing access to content of certain websites and other internet properties on our network. there can be no assurance that we will not face similar litigation in the future or that we will prevail in any litigation we are facing or may face. an adverse decision in one or more of these lawsuits could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. several u.s. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various activities of our customers, including the digital millennium copyright act (dmca), which provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe their rights under u.s. copyright law have been infringed on the internet; and section 230, enacted in the communications decency act (cda), which addresses blocking and screening of content on the internet. although these and other similar legal provisions provide limited protections from liability for service providers like us, those protections may not be interpreted in a way that applies to us, may be amended or removed in the future, or may not provide us with complete protection from liability claims. if we are found not to be protected by the safe harbor provisions of the dmca, cda or other similar laws, or if we are deemed subject to laws in other countries that may not have the same protections or that may impose more onerous obligations on us, we may owe substantial damages and our brand, reputation, and financial results may be harmed. policies and laws in this area remain highly dynamic, and we may face additional theories of intermediary liability in various jurisdictions. many policymakers in the united states have called for a re-examination of cda section 230 and copyright law. the eu has agreed on the digital services act and digital markets act to update the rules governing digital services like ours, including replacing the ecommerce directive, which is the eu’s current framework for online services, and imposing additional legal requirements on certain service providers. in addition, in 2019, the eu approved a copyright directive that will impose additional obligations on service providers and failure to comply could give rise to significant liability. other laws and pending legislation at the eu level (terrorist content, child sexual abuse materials) and in the united kingdom (online harms), australia (online harms), and india (digital india act), as well as other new laws like them, may also expose internet companies like us to significant liability. we may incur additional costs to comply with these new laws, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. current and future litigation subjects us to claims for very large potential damages based on a significant number of online occurrences under statutory or other damage theories. such claims may result in liability that exceeds our ability to pay or our insurance coverage. even if claims against us are ultimately unsuccessful, defending against such claims will increase our legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations."
NET,"our policies regarding user privacy could cause us to experience adverse business and reputational consequences with customers, employees, suppliers, government entities, and other third parties. as a company, we strive to protect our customers’ privacy consistent with applicable law. consequently, we generally do not provide personal information about our customers or their users without legal process. in accordance with our contractual commitments to our customers, we may need to challenge legal process requesting disclosure of personal information where such requests are inconsistent with applicable data protection  laws. in addition, from time to time, government entities may seek or demand our assistance with obtaining information about our customers or their users or could request that we modify our network and products in a manner to permit access or monitoring. in light of our privacy commitments, we may legally challenge certain law enforcement requests, such as requests to provide a feed of content transiting our network, to obtain encryption keys, or to modify or weaken encryption. we also may face complaints from individuals who assert we have provided their information improperly to law enforcement or in response to third-party abuse complaints, despite policies we have in place to protect that information. to the extent that we do not provide assistance to or comply with requests from government entities or challenge those requests publicly or in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences. we may also face such adverse political, business, and reputational consequences to the extent that we provide, or are perceived as providing, assistance to government entities that exceeds our legal obligations. for example, we periodically receive requests for information purportedly originating from law enforcement agencies or pursuant to legal process, but which are fraudulent or improper attempts to cause us to reveal customer information. any such disclosure could significantly and adversely impact our business and reputation. we publish a transparency report on a semi-annual basis to provide details of law enforcement and government requests we receive. our transparency report also includes a list of certain actions we have not taken in response to law enforcement requests. if we are ever required by law enforcement to take one or more of the actions covered by those disclosures, then we would have to remove the applicable disclosures from our transparency report. both the publishing of our transparency report and, conversely, the potential narrowing of the list of actions we have not taken in response to law enforcement requests could damage our business and reputation. our business could be adversely impacted by changes in internet access for our customers as a result of competitive behavior or laws specifically governing the internet. our network performance and reliability depends on the quality of our customers’ access to the internet. certain features of our network require significant bandwidth and fidelity to work effectively. internet access is frequently provided by companies that have significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to our network, which would negatively impact our business. we could incur greater operating expenses and our customer acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted if other network operators:  implement usage-based pricing;  discount pricing for competitive products;  otherwise materially change their pricing rates or schemes;  charge us to deliver our traffic at certain levels or at all;  throttle traffic based on its source or type;  implement bandwidth caps or other usage restrictions; or  otherwise try to monetize or control access to their networks. in addition, there are various laws and regulations that could impede the growth of the internet or online services, and new laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. these laws and regulations could involve interconnection and network management; taxation; tariffs; privacy; data protection; information security; content; copyrights; distribution; electronic contracts and other communications; consumer protection; and requirements for the characteristics and quality of services, any of which could decrease the demand for, or the usage of, our products. legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. if these changes are implemented, it could have an adverse and negative impact on our business. in addition, we may be banned from providing our products in certain countries, which would prevent our ability to grow our business in such markets and would also have a detrimental impact on the performance and scope of our network. russia, for example, has blocked designated virtual private networks since december 2021, and included one of our products, cloudflare warp, in its list of banned services. these changes or increased costs could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and non-u.s. governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with various legal obligations, such as privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations, intellectual property laws, telecommunications laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, governmental trade sanctions laws, import and export controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. in addition, emerging tools and technologies we may utilize in providing our products and solutions, like artificial intelligence and machine learning, may also become subject to regulation under new laws or new applications of existing laws. in certain jurisdictions, some or all of these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states.  in addition, many countries are considering expanding or have expanded regulatory requirements for services such as ours, with potential requirements such as collection and verification of customer data, limitations on the use of non-personal data, cybersecurity incident reporting obligations, expanded registration requirements, or requirements to have personnel in the country. the rapid expansion of proposed regulations, as well as possible conflicting requirements, may make it challenging for us to identify and comply with all new global regulations that may apply to our services. these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business. actual or perceived noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:  investigations, enforcement actions, and sanctions;  mandatory changes to our network and products;  disgorgement of profits, fines, and damages;  civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;  claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;  termination of contracts;  loss of intellectual property rights; and  temporary or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of our management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. additionally, companies in the technology industry have recently experienced increased regulatory scrutiny. the rapid growth of our business and the products that we offer may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our company in particular. any reviews by regulatory agencies or legislatures may result in substantial regulatory fines, changes to our business practices, and other penalties, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. changes in social, political, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may cause us to change our business practices. further, our expansion into a variety of new fields also could raise a number of new regulatory issues. these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations in material ways. our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection, information security, and other applicable laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our business. we receive, store, use, and otherwise process personal information and other information relating to individuals. there are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security, and the storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules. not only is the number of data protection laws rising  globally and within the united states, but existing laws and regulations are evolving. together, this legislative framework may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. for example, the eu’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues. in addition, the gdpr and the data protection laws of a number of other jurisdictions such as japan, china, and south korea, prohibit cross-border data transfers unless certain contractual and other conditions are met. this requires us to incur substantial costs and engage in additional contract negotiations with some of our customers and vendors to ensure the conditions established by these data protection regulations are met.  some countries are also considering or have enacted legislation and/or certification schemes requiring local storage and processing of data, or other sovereignty-oriented requirements, that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. for example, the european union agency for cybersecurity’s draft version of the european cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services would require eu data sovereignty for companies seeking to obtain the highest certification level.  in addition, the interpretation of existing privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations by governmental entities and the courts may change significantly over time in a manner that can have a significantly adverse impact on both our business and our customers’ businesses. for example, in july 2020, the court of justice of the european union (cjeu) in the ""schrems ii"" case invalidated the u.s.-eu privacy shield that was widely used by us and other companies to allow for the lawful transfer of personal data of european economic area (eea) residents to the united states for processing under the gdpr and placed additional requirements on the use of the eu standard contractual clauses (eu sccs) as a mechanism for transferring eea personal data to the united states. we incurred substantial costs and needed to engage in additional contract negotiations with some of our customers and vendors in connection with updated eu sccs and the united kingdom addendum to the eu sccs or other appropriate contractual provisions that we sought to put in place with our customers and vendors. in july 2023, the european commission adopted an adequacy decision for the new eu-u.s. data privacy framework, which is designed to address the concerns raised in the schrems ii case. however, the european commission’s adequacy decision regarding this framework will be subject to future reviews and may be subject to suspension, amendment, repeal, or limitations to its scope by the european commission. while this new framework may serve as a means for cloud service providers like our company to freely transfer eu personal data to the united states, many aspects of this new framework remain uncertain. it has already been subject to legal challenge, and some customers and vendors are unwilling to rely on the new framework due to this uncertainty. in addition, in january 2023, the european data protection board issued its 2022 coordinated enforcement action on the use of cloud-based services by the public sector, in which it expressed concerns that eu public sector entities may not be able to use u.s.-based cloud service providers consistently with gdpr due to their concerns about the ability of u.s. government agencies to access eu personal data.  whether as a result of this or otherwise, we may continue to see more findings from privacy regulators around the world against cloud service providers relating to cross-border personal data transfers, and may find it necessary or appropriate to modify our policies and practices to address any such findings or other legislative developments relating to cross-border personal data transfers. implementing any new guidance from applicable regulatory authorities and otherwise responding to or addressing developments relating to cross-border personal data transfers may result in substantial costs, require changes to our policies and business practices, require us to engage in additional contractual negotiations, limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, limit our ability to provide certain products to certain customers, or materially adversely affect our business and operating results. meanwhile, the united kingdom's data protection legislation is substantially consistent with the gdpr, and the uk has adopted an extension to the eu-u.s. data privacy framework, but it remains to be seen how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated and enforced in the longer term. to the extent future united kingdom data protection requirements diverge significantly from the gdpr, they may result in substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, limit our ability to provide certain products to certain customers, or materially adversely affect our business and operating results.  we also expect that there will continue to be new, and amendments to existing, laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in the united states and various individual u.s. states. in the united states, various federal laws and regulations already apply to the  collection, processing, disclosure and security of certain types of data, including the electronic communications privacy act, the computer fraud and abuse act, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, and the gramm-leach-bliley act. in addition, there are also a number of recently enacted or proposed u.s. federal and state privacy and data protection bills in congress and state legislatures across the country.  we are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. we strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security to the extent possible. however, the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is evolving rapidly, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. as data protection compliance complexity grows, we may be required to incur substantial costs to adapt our policies and business practices as well as engage in additional contractual negotiations. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, applicable laws or regulations, or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability or cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could cause them to cease or reduce use of our products and otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products. additionally, if third parties we work with, such as sub-processors, vendors, or developers, violate applicable laws or regulations, contractual obligations, or our policies—or if it is perceived that such violations have occurred—such actual or perceived violations may also have an adverse effect on our business. further, any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, or other processing of users’ content, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, disclosure, or other processing of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our network, products, and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may limit our ability to store and process customer data or develop new products and features. we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, the uk bribery act 2010, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making, or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the public sector. we leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our products, host many of our co-location facilities for our network, and conduct our business in the united states and abroad. we and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. further, some of our international sales activity occurs, and some of our network infrastructure is located, in parts of the world that are recognized as having a greater potential for business practices that violate anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or similar laws. we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents, including our channel partners, have complied with, or in the future will comply with, our policies and applicable law. as we continue to increase our international sales and business and expand our network globally, our risks under these laws may increase. the investigation of possible violations of these laws, including internal investigations and compliance reviews that we may conduct from time to time, could have a material adverse effect on our business. actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts and other contracts, other enforcement actions, the appointment of a monitor, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. other internal  and government investigations, regulatory proceedings, or litigation, including private litigation filed by our stockholders, may also follow as a consequence. any investigations, actions, or sanctions could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. further, the promulgation of new anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, rules or regulations or new interpretations of current anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, rules or regulations could impact the way we do business in other countries, including requiring us to change certain aspects of our business to ensure compliance, which could reduce revenue, increase costs, or subject us to additional liabilities. we may face fines, penalties, or other costs, either directly or vicariously, if any of our partners, resellers, contractors, vendors or other third parties fail to adhere to their compliance obligations under our policies and applicable law. we use a number of partners, resellers, contractors, vendors and other third parties to perform services or act on our behalf in areas like sales, network infrastructure, administration, research, and marketing. it may be the case that one or more of those third parties fail to adhere to our policies or violate applicable federal, state, local, and international laws, including but not limited to, those related to corruption, bribery, economic sanctions, and export/import controls. despite the significant challenges in asserting and maintaining control and compliance by these third parties, we may be held fully liable for third parties’ actions as fully as if they were a direct employee of ours. such liabilities may create harm to our reputation, inhibit our plans for expansion, or lead to extensive liability either to private parties or government regulators, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions, requiring us to exercise judgment in determining the applicability of certain tax laws, and this could subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences and adversely impact our results of operations. we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions globally, including in the united states at the federal, state, and local levels, and in many other countries, and plan to continue to expand the scale of our operations in the future. as a result, we are subject to income tax in the united states and a number of other jurisdictions. in the ordinary course of our global business, we are also subject to various jurisdictional rules regarding the timing and allocation of revenue and expenses, resulting in intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. to the extent taxing authorities may disagree with our positions, it could result in additional taxes, interest, and penalties.  significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate may be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, and the effects from acquisitions. changes in accounting principles, changes in global tax laws, regulations or rates, or changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions could also impact our provision for income taxes. for example, the united states enacted the inflation reduction act in august 2022, which, among other provisions, implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, effective in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2022, and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, effective for repurchases made after december 31, 2022, which could include transactions with respect to capped call transactions such as those we entered into in 2020 and 2021. additionally, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) published model rules within the oecd/g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting (the inclusive framework) to address the challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. the inclusive framework includes provisions related to the taxation of the digital economy and the establishment of a 15% global minimum tax under pillar two. while several countries have adopted, or intend to adopt, parts of the inclusive framework, some other countries are considering similar changes to their existing tax laws. any of the foregoing changes could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. from time to time, we may be subject to income tax audits. while we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that we have complied with all applicable tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes, including with respect to intercompany transfer pricing. we cannot ensure that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from  what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals and that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations. our results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales and use, value-added, or similar taxes for our products in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so. we are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, property, and digital services taxes, in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. sales and use, value-added, goods and services, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. our customers can be located in one jurisdiction, utilize our network and products through our network equipment in a different jurisdiction, and pay us from an account located in a third jurisdiction. this divergence, along with the jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction variance in tax laws, causes significant uncertainty in the tax treatment of our business. there is further uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient physical presence or nexus for a national, state, or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the internet. there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our network and products as not taxable in certain jurisdictions will be accepted by national, state, and local taxing authorities. in determining our tax filing obligations, management has made judgments regarding whether our activities in a jurisdiction rise to the level of taxability. these judgments may prove inaccurate, and one or more states or countries may seek to impose additional sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales made by us.  we currently face, and in the future may continue to face, non-income tax audits. in the event of an adverse audit outcome, tax authorities could assert that we are obligated to collect additional taxes from our customers, which could exceed our estimated liabilities. a successful assertion by a state, country, or other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes on our network and products could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage customers from purchasing our network and products, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. under certain circumstances, our income tax obligations may be reduced as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. as of december 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards for u.s. federal and state income tax purposes of $1,385.1 million and $756.1 million, which will begin to expire in 2029 and 2030, respectively. we had net operating loss carryforwards for u.k. income tax purposes of $207.2 million that can be carried forward indefinitely. also as of december 31, 2023, we had u.s. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $63.6 million and $29.8 million that will begin to expire in 2029 and 2039, respectively. utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, may be subject to annual limitations, or could be subject to other limitations on utilization or benefit due to the ownership change limitations provided by sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code), and other similar provisions. under sections 382 and 383 of the code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. in general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. similar rules may apply under state tax laws. we may have experienced various ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside our control.  net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could expire before utilization and could be subject to limitations, which could harm our business, revenue, and financial results. it is also possible that federal, state, and non-u.s. tax authorities will enact additional legislation limiting our ability to use our carryforwards, some of which may adversely impact our business. if we are deemed an investment company under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act), applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. under the 1940 act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” if (1) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (2) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. we do not believe that we are an “investment company” under the 1940 act. we have historically qualified for an exemption from registration under the 1940 act for “research and development companies” as defined in rule 3a-8 promulgated under the 1940 act. to provide clarity on our investment company status in the longer term, we applied for and, in april 2023, received an order from the sec stating that we are primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and therefore not an investment company, subject to compliance with certain conditions. notwithstanding the exemptive order, we believe that we have never been an investment company because, among other reasons, we are primarily engaged in the business of a global cloud services provider. we intend to operate our business as described in the exemptive order; however, it is possible that our business will change in the future. if the sec were to find that the circumstances that gave rise to the issuance of the exemptive order no longer exist, the sec may revoke the exemptive order. if the exemptive order were revoked or we are unable otherwise to rely on the exemptive order or another applicable exemption, we may be required to institute burdensome requirements to comply with the 1940 act, which may restrict our activities in a way that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition."
NET,"risks related to international operations our international operations expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. historically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from outside the united states. we derived 48%, 47%, and 48% of our revenue from our international customers for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes expansion into geographies around the world, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. in addition, our global network includes co-location facilities located in more than 310 cities and over 120 countries worldwide as of december 31, 2023. we expect that our international sales and network activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets and further grow our network around the world. these international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including:  geopolitical, economic, and social uncertainties, including the potential nationalization of key peering partners by foreign governments or political unrest that affects our ability to continue to work with particular peering partners, potential terrorist activities, military conflict or war, trade policies and sanctions, and the unknown impact of regional or global health crises, or epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the covid-19 pandemic;"
NET," changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;  unexpected costs for the localization of our products, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices, certifications, and legal and regulatory requirements;  greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection, and longer collection periods;  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;  requirements to open local offices or otherwise maintain a local presence in some countries;  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties, including with respect to our business in china;  increased risk to our local employees of government pressure, including potential threats of prosecution or imprisonment, in connection with enforcement of local legal and regulatory requirements;  greater risk of a failure of foreign employees and channel partners to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, anti-bribery laws, export and import control laws, and any applicable trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;  heightened security risks associated with our co-location facilities and related equipment in high-risk countries and the software code and systems access shared with our service providers located in such countries, including in the hong kong region as a result of the national security law passed in june 2020;  greater security and oversight risks associated with third-party contractors that we use to install and maintain our hardware in co-location facilities in foreign countries and the limited background checks and screening that we can perform on such service providers;  laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection, security requirements, data localization, or content restriction that could pose risks to our intellectual property, increase the cost of doing business in a country, subject us to greater risks of claims and enforcement actions by regulators or others, subject us and our current and potential customers to burdensome requirements, increase the chance that current and potential customers may be unable to use our products or may be required to lessen or alter how they use our products, or create other disadvantages to our business or negative impacts on our results of operations;  increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;  greater difficulty in identifying, attracting, and retaining local qualified personnel and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;  differing employment practices and labor relations issues, which may make expansion or contraction of our workforce, or changes in the terms of employment, in such countries more costly and time-consuming and subject us to a greater risk of disputes or litigation;  increased regulatory requirements and litigation risk related to the presence of our physical infrastructure in countries around the world;  difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with operating multiple international locations; and  fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business, particularly the united kingdom, the european union, and singapore where we have large offices or a large number of employees and pay employees in local currency. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business. in particular, we are exposed to risks in china, which amounts to a significant part of both our short-term and long-term revenue growth plans. our chinese operations are substantially dependent on our relationship with jd cloud and due to economic and political challenges in servicing the chinese market, the loss of this arrangement could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations. geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts between hamas and israel and between russia and ukraine or other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening or expanding of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions, may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions. in addition, heightened use of trade restrictions and sanctions, including tariffs or prohibitions on technology transfers to achieve diplomatic ends could impact our ability to conduct our business as planned. as discussed in greater detail above in our risk factor titled “our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection, information security, and other applicable laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our business,” recent changes in privacy and data protection laws in a number of countries and supranational organizations have created uncertainty around the requirements related to transfers of personal data between jurisdictions, including transfers to the united states. as a result of this uncertainty, our current and potential customers in certain regions may be concerned about whether they are able to transfer personal data to the united states in connection with the usage of our global network and products. if these concerns result in our current and  potential customers in those regions reducing their usage of our products, then our results of operations could be adversely impacted. further, we anticipate needing to identify different transfer mechanisms and/or change our use of certain standard contractual clauses in order to lawfully transfer certain personal data from those regions to the united states. this could result in substantial costs, require changes to our policies and business practices, require us to engage in additional contractual obligations, limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, or materially adversely affect our business and operating results. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations. substantially all of our sales contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar has increased and may continue to increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states, which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to discount our products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. as our international operations expand, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states and is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the british pound, euro, and singapore dollar. in addition, in the future we may begin to generally allow customers in some countries outside the united states to pay us for our products in the currencies of those countries. accordingly, our revenue and operating expenses may be increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. as we continue to expand our international operations, we may become more exposed to foreign currency risk or remeasurement risk. if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. our business could be adversely impacted by the decision of foreign governments, internet service providers, or others, to block transmission from cloudflare ip addresses or domains in order to enforce certain internet content blocking efforts. some of our security products involve making origin ip addresses and other operational assets of our customers more difficult for cyber attackers to target. the evolving design of our network and products may create challenges for various organizations, including governments, that seek to block certain content based on ip address “block lists” or other mechanisms. this problem is exacerbated by the fact that a single cloudflare ip address may be used for a number of internet properties, and the cloudflare ip used for any one internet property may change over time. this means that efforts by isps to block a single domain name may end up blocking a number of other domains or content. if these challenges become too difficult for those organizations to overcome, they could make the decision to block content in an overbroad manner or block completely websites and other internet properties that are using our network and/or transmitted using known cloudflare ip addresses. some of these blocking efforts would be out of our control once they have been put in place and may limit our ability to provide our products on a fully global basis, which could reduce demand for our products among current or potential customers that are focused on the impacted regions or could otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our network presence within china is dependent upon our commercial relationship with jd cloud, and any detrimental changes in, or the termination of, that relationship could jeopardize our ability to offer an integrated global network that includes china. we believe our offering of an integrated global network that includes facilities in china is important to our existing and potential future customers. our ability to continue to offer an integrated network presence that includes china currently is dependent on our commercial relationship with jd cloud. regulation of internet infrastructure and traffic by the chinese government creates challenges to the peering of chinese and non-chinese networks. we have a strategic agreement with jd cloud to provide solutions that accommodate the requirements imposed by chinese regulations through jd cloud's development and operation of facilities in china that are included as part of our network. our original agreement with jd cloud was announced in 2020 and was set to expire in april 2023. a new agreement, extending the relationship, was executed in april 2023 and is set to expire in march 2026. the new agreement contains economic terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of the original agreement. consistent with the original agreement, our new agreement with jd cloud is subject to earlier termination by either party under certain circumstances such as the other party’s material breach and can be terminated by jd cloud  under certain circumstances if necessary chinese governmental approvals are revoked or become limited or impaired or if public law or regulatory action by the chinese or u.s. government expressly prohibits or materially restricts the collaboration contemplated by the agreement. the risk of such an early termination event may have increased during the current environment of economic trade negotiations and tensions between the chinese and u.s. governments. our customers that use our network presence in china through our jd cloud commercial relationship are subject to chinese laws and regulations of internet infrastructure, traffic, and content. under our agreement with jd cloud, in some circumstances, these customers’ use of our chinese network presence can be terminated if they violate these laws and regulations. the removal of our customers from our chinese network presence could result in these customers deciding to terminate their overall relationship with us. in addition, any adverse publicity associated with the removal of some or all of our customers from our chinese network presence as a result of the application of chinese laws and regulations could cause us to experience adverse reputational and business consequences. if our commercial relationship with jd cloud is terminated, identifying an alternative solution in china could be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. even if an alternative solution is identified, we cannot be certain that the economic terms or performance of any such alternative arrangement will be comparable to our existing relationship with jd cloud, which could materially negatively impact our financial results and customer satisfaction with such alternative arrangement. a lack of network presence in china would represent a significant loss of utility to many of our customers and could materially harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. we are subject to governmental trade sanctions laws, and export and import controls, that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our business activities are subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control (ofac) and u.s. export control and similar foreign laws and regulations, including the u.s. department of commerce’s export administration regulations (ear). we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products, and the encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside the united states only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of classification requests or self-classification reports. further, the u.s. economic sanctions laws and export control laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of most products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities. even though we take precautions and have implemented policies and practices to assist in compliance, there is a risk that we may not be in full compliance with these laws. in 2019, we learned that we may have failed to comply with certain u.s. export-related filing and reporting requirements and may have submitted incorrect information to the u.s. government in connection with certain hardware exports. upon learning of these potential violations and associated export control requirements, we promptly initiated a voluntary internal review and are taking remedial measures to prevent similar export control anomalies from occurring in the future. in may 2019, we submitted an initial voluntary self-disclosure to the bureau of industry and security regarding potential violations of ear and a voluntary self-disclosure to the census bureau regarding potential violations of the foreign trade regulations. in july 2019, we filed the full and complete voluntary self-disclosures. the voluntary self-disclosure to the census bureau was completed with no penalties in november 2019. the voluntary self-disclosure to the bureau of industry and security was completed with no penalties in june 2020. in may 2019, we submitted an initial voluntary self-disclosure to ofac related to our non-compliance with certain economic and trade sanctions programs, and we filed the full and complete voluntary self-disclosure to ofac in july 2019. specifically, we identified that our products were used by, or for the benefit of, certain individuals and entities included in ofac’s specially designated nationals and blocked persons list, including entities identified in ofac’s counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics trafficking sanctions programs and individuals or entities affiliated with governments currently subject to comprehensive u.s. sanctions or located in regions subject to comprehensive sanctions. a small number of these parties made payments to us in connection with their use of our products. the voluntary self-disclosure, which we may supplement as appropriate, remains under an ongoing review by ofac. although we have implemented, and are working to implement additional controls and screening tools designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, there is no guarantee that we will not inadvertently provide our products to additional individuals, entities, or governments prohibited by u.s. sanctions in the future.  additionally, we currently provide products to certain ofac-sanctioned regions based upon general licenses issued by ofac to engage in such activity. we continue to review the ofac sanctions and our practices to verify compliance. these efforts related to export controls and ofac sanctions could result in negative consequences for us, including costs related to government investigations, financial penalties and harm to our reputation. the impact on us related to these matters could be substantial. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide our products and operate our network or could limit our customers’ ability to access or use our network and products in those countries. if we are found to have violated the u.s. or foreign laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. we may be materially and adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, loss of customers, or otherwise. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. in addition, changes in our network, products, or screening process, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, could delay the introduction and sale of subscriptions to our products in international markets, prevent customers in certain countries from accessing our network and products or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our network and products to certain countries, governments, persons, or entities altogether. any decrease in our ability to sell our products could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition."
NET,"risks related to intellectual property we are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation matters that, if resolved adversely, could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we own a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and, from time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. in addition, a number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret, trademark, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have in the past been, are currently, and may from time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to intellectual property, our business practices, and our products. for example, we are a defendant in lawsuits, both in the united states and abroad, seeking injunctive relief and/or damages against us based on claims of alleged patent infringement and claims of alleged copyright infringement through content on our customers’ websites. we may also be subject to governmental and other regulatory investigations from time to time. the costs of supporting litigation and dispute resolution proceedings are considerable, and there can be no assurances that a favorable outcome will be obtained. disputes, whether or not favorably resolved, also may generate negative publicity and damage our reputation. we may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. the terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. with respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. a license to continue such practices may not be available to us at all, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. the development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense. our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected as a result."
NET,"indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. our agreements with certain of our customers or other third parties may include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from the use of our network and products or other acts or omissions. the term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. we have in the past been sued on the basis of alleged violation of intellectual property rights in the form of patents and trade secrets. although we were successful in defending the claims to date, as we continue to grow, the possibility of these and other intellectual property rights claims against us may increase. for any intellectual property rights indemnification claim against us or our customers, we may incur significant legal expenses and have to pay damages, pay license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may also have to seek a license for the disputed technology, but such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain products. as a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our network or products, which could negatively affect our business. from time to time, customers require us to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for breach of confidentiality, violation of applicable law, or failure to implement adequate security measures with respect to their data stored, transmitted, or accessed using our network and products. our standard enterprise plan agreements provide limited indemnification to our customers based on third-party claims related to our violation of intellectual property rights, and some of our enterprise plan agreements offer indemnification for claims beyond that scope. the existence of such a dispute may have adverse effects on our customer relationship and reputation and we may still incur substantial liability related to them. any assertions by a third party, whether or not successful, with respect to such indemnification obligations could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, expensive remediation and licenses, divert management attention and financial resources, harm our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our products, and harm our brand, business, results of operations, and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets. we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret, domain name protection, trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties in order to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information. as of december 31, 2023, we had 290 issued patents and 67 pending patent applications in the united states and abroad. however, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights. third parties may challenge our intellectual property rights, pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved, and we may not be able to prevent infringement, misappropriation, or violations of our intellectual property rights without incurring substantial expense. we have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes, and we provide access to these technologies and processes to certain of our vendors and partners, including jd cloud with respect to the facilities included within our network in china. we must protect this proprietary information in order to realize commercial benefit from our investment. in order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties. these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. further, errors made by our employees or contractors in utilizing artificial intelligence or machine learning in our products or in the operation of our business could result in proprietary or other confidential information being exposed externally. in addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets or develop similar technologies and processes, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against them. laws in certain jurisdictions may afford little or no trade secret protection, and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. we may not be effective in policing  unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, and even if we do detect violations, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and any such litigation could be unsuccessful, lead to the invalidation of our proprietary rights, or lead to counterclaims by other parties against us. if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our network and products, brand, and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our network and products and their features. any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we depend and rely upon software and technologies licensed from third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or the unavailability of these technologies may adversely affect our products, network, business, and results of operations. we rely on software, services, and other technology from third parties that we incorporate into, or integrate with, our network and products. we also rely on software, services, and other technology from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management services. if the software, services, or other technology we rely on become unavailable due to extended outages, the third-party provider disabling our access, expiration or termination of licenses, or because they are otherwise no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, and our ability to operate our network, provide our products, and our results of operations could be impaired until equivalent software, technology, or services are obtained or replacements are developed, all of which could adversely affect our business. if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties now or in the future, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance. this could limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and increase our costs of production. as a result, our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed. we cannot be certain that those from whom we license software and other technology are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products. accordingly, our use of this intellectual property may expose us to third-party claims of infringement. in addition, many licenses are non-exclusive and may not prevent our competitors from licensing the same technology on equivalent or more favorable terms. some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, we license some of our software through open source projects and we voluntarily make available some of our software on an open source basis, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our products, subject us to possible litigation, and be used by other companies to compete against us. our network and products incorporate software licensed under open source licenses, including open source software included in software we receive from third-party commercial software vendors. use of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, updates, or warranties, or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the software. in addition, the wide availability of source code incorporated in our products could allow hostile parties to more easily identify security vulnerabilities in our network and products. the terms of some open source licenses may provide that under certain conditions we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, including authorizing further modification and redistribution. in the event that certain portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to such requirements by an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our network or applicable products, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our products, each of which provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our products, and could reduce or eliminate the value of our products. because the terms of open source licenses are novel and have not been widely interpreted by courts, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or by third parties seeking to enforce the terms of open source licenses against us in a manner we do not anticipate. in addition, we voluntarily make available certain portions of our software on an open source basis to the public and such software could then be used by other companies to compete against us. any unanticipated disclosure of, or litigation regarding, our source code and any open source software incorporated into our source code could result in adverse judgments and liabilities, require us to reengineer all or a portion of our network and products, limit the marketing of our products, provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create new security vulnerabilities or highlight existing security vulnerabilities in our network and products, and reduce or eliminate the value of our network and products. we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our network and products will be effective."
NET,"risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the trading price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the trading price of our class a common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our class a common stock include:"
NET," price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks or high growth companies;  changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology or high growth companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;  sales of shares of our class a common stock and class b common stock by us or our stockholders;  issuance of shares of our class a common stock and class b common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition, upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding 2026 notes, or in connection with employee equity awards;  failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates or share price targets by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services or any delays in our general release of products we previously announced as being in development or beta testing;  the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the sec;  rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;  actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or

investments;  litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;  developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;  actual or perceived network or data security breaches or other network or data security incidents, including any network or product outages or failures;  announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;  failures or alleged failures to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business;  new laws or regulations or new amendments to, or interpretations of, existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;  any departure of one of our co-founders from our company or any other significant change in our management; and  general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets, including inflation and related changes in monetary policy, rising interest rates, volatile energy prices, and other impacts of the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, or other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, or any worsening or expanding of those conflicts or geopolitical tensions. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. this litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering, and it may depress the trading price of our class a common stock. our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share. as of december 31, 2023, our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, held in the aggregate 75.4% of the voting power of our capital stock, with our co-founders together holding approximately 54.8% of the voting power of our capital stock. because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock, the holders of our class b common stock collectively continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. this concentrated control will limit or preclude the ability of holders of class a common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. in addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. future transfers by holders of shares of class b common stock and the cessation of employment by holders of our class b common stock generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes and transfers between related entities. the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those individual holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.  in july 2017, ftse russell announced that it would cease to include most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures in its indices, including the russell 1000, russell 2000, and russell 3000. under the announced policies, our multi-class capital structure in some cases may make us ineligible for inclusion in some or all of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices may not invest in our stock if we are not included. it is unclear what effect, if any, these policies have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. previously, standard & poor’s also excluded companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures from its indices, including the s&p 500, the s&p midcap 400, and the s&p smallcap 600, which s&p indices together make up the s&p composite 1500. however, in april 2023, it reversed this policy and announced that companies with dual or multi-class capital structures will again be eligible for inclusion on its indices. we cannot be sure that such policy, or the policies of other indices, will not change further and make us ineligible for inclusion on the s&p composite 1500, or other indices, in the future. substantial future sales could depress the market price of our class a common stock. the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of such stock, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our class a common stock. under our investors’ rights agreement, certain stockholders can require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the united states. in addition, we file registration statements to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. as a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding rsu awards are available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market. sales of our shares may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. these sales also could cause the trading price of our class a common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our class a common stock. we have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our financing activities, and we may not use them effectively. we cannot specify with any certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we received from our prior financing activities, including from the issuances of the notes in 2020 and 2021, and our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. the failure by our management to apply these proceeds effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. pending their use, we may invest our proceeds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. our investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors and may negatively impact the price of our class a common stock.  delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our class a common stock. our status as a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:  our dual-class common stock structure, which provides mr. prince and ms. zatlyn with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock;  our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;  vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;  only the chair of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our entire board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;  certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware;  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of class a common stock;  advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;  our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent; and  any amendment of the above anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock. these anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect  directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our class a common stock. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the federal district courts of the united states will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the u.s. federal district courts will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, against any person in connection with any offering of our securities, including any auditor, underwriter, expert, control person, or other defendant. any person or entity purchasing, holding, or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. if a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations. our class a common stock market price and trading volume could decline if equity or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business. the trading market for our class a common stock depends in part on the research and reports that equity or industry analysts publish about us or our business. the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our class a common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. if few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our class a common stock to decline. an active trading market for our class a common stock may not be sustained. our class a common stock is listed on the nyse under the symbol “net.” however, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our class a common stock will be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our class a common stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares. we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment."
NET,"risks related to our outstanding convertible senior notes repaying and servicing our existing and future debt, including our 2026 notes, may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.  in august 2021, we issued $1,293.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes. as of december 31, 2023, the remaining aggregate principal amount was $1,293.8 million of the 2026 notes. our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2026 notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. in addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt."
NET,"in addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. for example, it could:  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general u.s. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;  limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital, and for other general corporate purposes; and  make an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult. any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the 2026 notes or to repurchase the 2026 notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the 2026 notes or to repurchase the 2026 notes. holders of the 2026 notes have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (which is defined in the 2026 indenture) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2026 notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date for such series of 2026 notes. in addition, upon conversion of the 2026 notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our class a common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 notes being converted. however, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2026 notes surrendered or 2026 notes being converted. in addition, our ability to repurchase the 2026 notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2026 notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. our failure to repurchase the 2026 notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the 2026 indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 notes as required by the 2026 indenture would constitute a default. a default under the 2026 indenture or the occurrence of a fundamental change under the 2026 notes could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2026 notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof in accordance with  the terms of the 2026 indenture. any failure by us to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2026 notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof, in each case, when required to do so pursuant to the terms of the 2026 indenture could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 notes, when triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. if the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 notes are entitled to convert their 2026 notes at any time during specified periods at their option. if one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our class a common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. in addition, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  transactions relating to the notes may affect the value of our class a common stock. the conversion of some or all of the 2026 notes would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our class a common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 notes. the 2026 notes may become convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances set forth in the 2026 indenture. if holders of the 2026 notes elect to convert their 2026 notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our class a common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders. in addition, from time to time, we may enter into certain exchange transactions with respect to the 2026 notes which may also cause dilution to our existing stockholders. for example, in august 2021, we entered into privately-negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2025 notes for the exchange of approximately $400.7 million in cash and approximately 7.6 million shares of our class a common stock for $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 notes. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2023, we settled conversions of approximately $35.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 notes for approximately 0.5 million shares of our class a common stock. these conversions were exercised by the holders of the 2025 notes in connection with our issuance of a redemption notice. in connection with the pricing of each series of notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the applicable option counterparties. the capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the applicable series of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.  in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the applicable option counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our class a common stock and/or purchased shares of our class a common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the applicable series of notes. from time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our class a common stock and/or purchasing or selling our class a common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable series of notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion, repurchase, or redemption of such notes, to the extent we exercise the relevant election under the applicable capped call transactions). this activity could also cause a decrease and/or increased volatility in the market price of our class a common stock. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions. the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. past macroeconomic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank, and the ubs takeover of credit suisse. if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we  will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our class a common stock. in addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our class a common stock. we can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties."
NET,"general risk factors  if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act), the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (the sarbanes-oxley act), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the new york stock exchange (the nyse). we expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the sec (including, without limitation, the new sec requirement to file current reports regarding material cybersecurity incidents) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. we are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and significant management oversight. in addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404(b) of the sarbanes-oxley act annually. testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. if material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, and we could incur substantial expenses. our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the sec. ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our class a common stock. in addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the nyse."

establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. any of our locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our corporate headquarters in the san francisco bay area and one of our core co-location facilities located in the greater portland, oregon area have experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events and at an increasing frequency, including severe storms, floods, drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with these types of events. additionally, it will remain difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees who continue to work remotely. changing market dynamics, global policy developments and increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the united states and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our partners, suppliers and customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the listing requirements of the nyse, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increases demand on our systems and resources. the exchange act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations.  the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. in order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. we are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis and to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. as a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. although we have already hired additional employees and have engaged outside consultants to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage additional outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their  application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. failure to comply with the aforementioned rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. as a result of disclosure of information in our filings with the sec, our business and financial condition are visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. if such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations."
AMD,"item 1a. risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously. risk factors summary the following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
AMD,economic and strategic risks  intel corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.  economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns.  the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. there may be fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries.
AMD," the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.  we are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics.  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.  our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.  if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.  unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us."
AMD,"operational and technology risks  we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected."
AMD," essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes may not be available to us.  we may fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products.  the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting significant industry transitions.  our revenue from our semi-custom system-on-chip (soc) products is dependent upon our semi-custom soc products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products.  our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.  it outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  we may encounter difficulties in operating our newly upgraded enterprise resource planning (erp) system.  uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.  our ability to design and introduce new products includes the use of third-party intellectual property.  we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.  if we lose microsoft corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.  our reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board (aib) partners subjects us to certain risks.  our business depends on the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems.  our products may not be compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware.  costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.  we may fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand.  we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions.  we may be unable to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market.  climate change may have a long-term impact on our business."
AMD,"legal and regulatory risks  government actions and regulations may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.  if we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, including as a result of tax regulation changes.  we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation.  we are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, and other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.  evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers."

AMD,"general risks  our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters.  we may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.  our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.  our stock price is subject to volatility. for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below."
AMD,"economic and strategic risks intel corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field. intel’s microprocessor market share position, significant financial resources, introduction of competitive new products, and existing relationships with top-tier oems have enabled it to market and price its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. these aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. intel also dominates the computer system platform and has a heavy influence on pc manufacturers, other pc industry participants, and benchmarks. it is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. we may be materially adversely affected by intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; and exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners. we expect intel to continue to heavily invest substantial resources in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. we also compete with intel in field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) and adaptive soc products. in the graphics processing unit (gpu) market, intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete gpus, including gaming focused discrete gpus. intel could take actions that place our gpus at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies."
AMD,"economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. uncertain global or regional economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. uncertainty in the economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, recession, slowing growth, increased unemployment, tighter credit markets, changes in fiscal monetary or trade policy, or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to stop or postpone purchases. for example, our client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the pc market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. the risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. adverse changes in economic conditions could increase costs of memory, equipment, materials or substrates and other supply chain expenses. if we are not able to procure a stable supply of materials on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a supply shortage or an increase in production costs, which could negatively impact our gross margin and materially adversely affect our business. in addition, uncertain economic conditions could lead to higher borrowing costs and reduced availability of capital and credit markets, making it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. an economic downturn or increased uncertainty could also lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments.  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. we have incurred substantial losses in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment. such industry-wide fluctuations may materially adversely affect us in the future.  global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. for example, our client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the pc market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.  the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. if demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. we offer products that are used in different end markets and the demand for our products can vary among our data center, client, gaming and embedded end markets. for instance, in our data center segment, we offer products that are optimized for generative ai applications and in the fourth quarter of 2023, we experienced significant demand for our ai accelerators. the demand for such products will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generative ai solutions in a wide variety of applications. also, in our client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook pc segments. our client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the pc market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. in the past, revenues from the client and gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. in addition, our gpu revenue in the past has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market (including potential actions by global monetary authorities), our gpu business could be materially adversely affected. the success of our semi-custom soc products in our gaming segment is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of game console systems and next generation consoles for sony and microsoft. our embedded segment primarily includes embedded cpus and gpus, apus, fpgas and adaptive soc products some of which are subject to macroeconomic trends and volatile business conditions. to the extent our embedded customers are faced with higher inventory levels, they may choose to draw down their existing inventory and order less of our products. our embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023.  the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. if one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, or has operations that are materially impaired for a significant period of time such that it is unable to receive or utilize our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. we are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including the covid-19 pandemic, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. global health outbreaks, such as covid-19, have and may continue to adversely affect our employees, disrupt our business operations and practices, as well those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. public health measures by government authorities such as travel bans, social-distancing, lockdown measures, vaccination requirements may cause us to incur additional costs, limit our operations, modify our business practices, diminish employee productivity or disrupt our supply chain, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. to the extent a public health crisis will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations depends on factors outside of our control, including severity, duration and the measures to contain the health outbreak.  the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. we believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are total cost of ownership, timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as artificial intelligence (ai)), energy efficiency relating to power consumption and battery life given their impact on total cost of ownership, reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools, completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. we may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. in addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market or during challenging economic times, leading to lower prices and margins. some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. for instance, with our apu products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. if competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the pc market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing markets, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing markets, and nvidia has added an arm cpu offering which adds competition in the cpu market. also, increased adoption of arm-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the arm ecosystem. while we see significant opportunity in ai, we expect intense competition from companies such as nvidia in the supply of gpus and other accelerators for the ai market. in addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. we may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.  from time to time, governments provide incentives or make other investments that could benefit and give a competitive advantage to our competitors. for example, the united states government enacted the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors for america and science act (chips act) of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the u.s. semiconductor industry. government incentives, including the chips act, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if our competitors can benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our competitors’ relative position and have a material adverse effect on our business. our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. the profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. a large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. in addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. for example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad. any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. in addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. in jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the u.s. and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. as a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in u.s. dollars. fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. an appreciation of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products."
AMD,"operational and technology risks we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. we utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. we rely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited (tsmc) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and gpu products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on globalfoundries inc. (gf) for wafers for microprocessor and gpu products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. we also utilize tsmc, united microelectronics corporation (umc) and samsung electronics co., ltd. for our integrated circuits (ic) in the form of programmable logic devices. we also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (atmp) our products. our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our products. it is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. we cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. in addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. for example, if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and gpu products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest ic products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. we do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. we obtain many of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. the manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and atmp products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages, or high heat events, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain environmental, social, atmospheric or natural, economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. if we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product. we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we are a party to a wafer supply agreement (wsa) with gf that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by gf and this agreement is in place through 2025. gf will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. if we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target, we will be required to pay to gf a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for such year. amd and gf also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025. we do not have any exclusivity commitments with gf, and we have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. if our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. if gf fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we are party to two atmp joint ventures (collectively, the atmp jvs) with affiliates of tongfu microelectronics co., ltd. the majority of our atmp services are provided by the atmp jvs and there is no guarantee that the atmp jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business."
AMD,"if essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. we may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. in addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. we also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of ic packages for our microprocessors, including our apu products. similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (pcbs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. if we are unable to procure a stable supply of memory, equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in memory, equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. if the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. conversely, a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers. because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another.  from time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. if we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.  failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our results of operations. semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. if our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. we cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, expand, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge manufacturing process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. for example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and gpu portfolio on tsmc’s processes. if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. moreover, we rely on tsmc, umc and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our ic products. therefore, the foundries, particularly tsmc which manufactures our newest ic products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. we cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. if we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors, product features preferences or requirements, consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. new investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. we cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. for example, as part of our pervasive ai strategy, we have a portfolio of hardware products and software tools to allow our customers to develop scalable and pervasive ai solutions. we are increasingly building ai capabilities into our products, but if we fail to develop and timely offer such products and technologies or keep pace with the product offerings of our competitors, our business could be adversely affected. additionally, our efforts in developing new ai technology solutions are inherently risky and may not always succeed. we may incur significant costs, resources, investments and delays and not achieve a return on investment or capitalize on the opportunities presented by demand for ai solutions. moreover, while ai adoption is likely to continue and may accelerate, the long-term trajectory of this technological trend is uncertain.  delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. if our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. the process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. we also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. if our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. in addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. if we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. our revenue from our semi-custom soc products is dependent upon our semi-custom soc products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products. the revenue that we receive from our semi-custom soc products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom soc products to these third parties. as a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom soc products being incorporated into those customers’ products. any revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. consequently, the semi-custom soc product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. the products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. we may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. we may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. we have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or results of operations. it outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. our business relies on technology hardware, software, cloud services, infrastructure, networks and systems (collectively, it systems). we own and manage some it systems but also rely on critical third-party it systems, products and services. in the ordinary course of business, we and various third-party providers and business partners process and maintain sensitive data, including personal information about workers, customers and others, as well as intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners (collectively, confidential data). maintaining the availability, integrity and security of our it systems and confidential data is critical to our business and reputation. while we and others have implemented various controls and defenses, amd and companies like amd and our vendors and customers have been and are increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats. threat actors range in sophistication from individual hackers and insiders to ransom gangs and state-sponsored attackers. cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our it systems or supply chain. the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements at amd and our providers present additional operational risks and attack vectors to our it systems. our it systems and confidential data are vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity risks and threats, including malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software, compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or systems, or those of a third party, that are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. cyberattacks have and may come into our it systems through the compromise of user’ access credentials. users’ access credentials can be compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (mfa) prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities.  threat actors are also increasingly using tools and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover from cyberattacks in a timely or effective manner. as ai capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cyberattacks created through ai. these attacks could be crafted with an ai tool to directly attack it systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. in addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an ai tool that includes a threat, such as introducing malicious code by incorporating ai generated source code. our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. cyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which individually or collectively could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position; unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of confidential data (such as intellectual property, sensitive business information or personally identifiable information (pii)); reputational harm and/or diminution in our competitiveness; loss of existing and/or future customers; litigation and/or regulatory investigations or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the diversion of management’s attention and key information technology resources. in addition, many governments have enacted and are continuing to enact strict privacy and security laws, such as the uk’s and european union’s general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (ccpa), as amended by the california privacy rights act (cpra), which provide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the ccpa and similar legislation, the basis for private claims for certain types of data breaches. we anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.  we may encounter difficulties in operating our newly upgraded enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us. we have recently upgraded our enterprise resource planning (erp) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. our newly upgraded erp system may not operate as we expect it to and may cause disruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. difficulties that may occur in connection with operating our newly upgraded erp system include disruptions to business continuity, administrative or technical problems, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, and interruptions or delays to our sales processes. any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. we base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. to the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. in addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. for example, our client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the pc market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. for instance, oems have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.  excess or obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the value of our inventory. for example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the gaming and client segments. factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.  our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property. in the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that incorporate into our software or hardware. the design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. if the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected. we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products. we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., bios, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. we also rely on our aib partners to support our products. in addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors. if the designers, manufacturers, aibs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected. if we lose microsoft corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. with respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our apu products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our products. in addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by microsoft. if microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. our reliance on third-party distributors and aib partners subjects us to certain risks. we market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and aib partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice. these agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and aib partners to offer our competitors’ products. we are dependent on our distributors and aib partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. if any significant distributor or aib partner or a substantial number of our distributors or aib partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. we extend credit to certain of our distributors and aib partners. if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or aib partners or incur higher allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and aib partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. additionally, distributors and aib partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. in most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. our agreements with aib partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. we rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. as such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. these changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. we continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyberattacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. in addition, as our it environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. however, these practices can also result in a more distributed it environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. if our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. if our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. we cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. in addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. as a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. a product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. as we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. if we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. we rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. in addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third-party distributors. from time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. in addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. climate change may have an adverse impact on our business and the business of our suppliers and customers. global climate change may result in certain natural disasters and climate-related events occurring with increasing frequency and severity and its physical impact on the u.s., china and other major regions where we have operations has the potential to disrupt our business and those of our customers and suppliers. our headquarters and some of our operations and facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes and tsunamis, wildfires, extreme storms, extreme heat, drought, freezing and other natural disasters. water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we have facilities and where our suppliers have operations is important to our business. certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business or those of our suppliers and customers. global climate change may also result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. such disruptions could cause delays in manufacturing or shipping our products, affect our supply chain and may result in the loss of business, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operation. we may also experience contractual disputes relating to supply chain delays resulting from climate change related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. data centers depend on access to clean water and reliable energy, thus potential power or water shortages could impair our customer’s ability to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.  although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on coverage, availability and cost. some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. additionally, our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. our business and the business of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to further climate-related regulations, contract terms and lawsuits. new increased regulations regarding carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel or energy taxes and other climate-related risks could result in greater costs; for example, as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased costs of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related expectations such as those affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections. the additional compliance costs incurred by our suppliers may be passed on to us and result in greater indirect costs to us. these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses, impacting our reputation if there is actual or perceived non-compliance, or requiring us to alter our operations and products. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry are unclear but could be severe."
AMD,"legal and regulatory risks government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.  we have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the thatic jv) with higon information technology co., ltd. (thatic), a third-party chinese entity. in june 2019, the bureau of industry and security (bis) of the united states department of commerce added certain chinese entities to the entity list, including thatic and the thatic jv. since that time, the united states administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy, including policies with respect to china and russia. specifically, united states-china trade relations remain uncertain as the united states continues to add more chinese companies to the entity list and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and emerging technologies such as ai. further, the united states and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against russia, belarus and the dnr and lnr regions of ukraine, due to the conflict in ukraine.  in october 2023, bis issued new requirements for certain advanced computing items that apply to the export of products classified eccn 3a090 or 4a090 to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, any of country groups d1, d4 or d5, including china. these controls prevent us from shipping our amd instinct™ mi250, mi300x, mi300a, mi388x integrated circuits and our versal™ vc2802, ve2802 fpgas to china, or to customers outside of the united states whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a d5 country (including china), without a license. these controls also require us to file a notified advanced computing (nac) notification with bis 25 days before shipping certain versal vc2602 and ve2602 fpgas to china, or to customers outside of the united states whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a d5 country (including china). in december 2023, bis published a series of frequently asked questions indicating an intent to revise certain sections of the controls issued in october. such revisions may bring certain other products including the amd instinct mi210 into the nac notification requirement. the nac notification process could result in bis prohibiting a shipment or requiring a license application before shipping a product that is the subject of a nac notification. bis may issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. even new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we have no assurances bis will agree that the alternative products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternative products. a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. there is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the united states, china or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. new export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the united states from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. in addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to provide services or develop products in the united states.  we may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the international traffic and arms regulations (itar), which are administered by the u.s. department of state. export administration regulation (ear) governs the export and re-export of certain amd products, including fpgas, as well as the transfer of related technologies or provision of services, whether in the u.s. or abroad. we are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet ear and itar requirements. an inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. when we file license applications or notification advanced computing (nac) exception notices we have no assurance that bis will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the bis will act on the filings in a timely manner. even if bis grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. in addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results."
AMD,"if we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. if we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under internal revenue code section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. the limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies. our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respective financial period. our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets. many countries have started to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organization for economic co-operation and development’s (oecd) base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. the oecd is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “pillar one” and “pillar two” proposals). the council of the european union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in pillar two and has directed eu member states to implement legislation enacting pillar two. many countries, including non-eu member states, have implemented laws based on pillar two proposals, which may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. as a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to review and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or existing tax rulings, and may have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and results of operations in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. from time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in note 17 - contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. for example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. on occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. it is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. with respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. if any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. these parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. the award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. we could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. our operations and properties are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. in addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict materials), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and real property. for the manufacturing of our products, these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. if our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. we have been named as a responsible party at three superfund sites in sunnyvale, california and we are subject to final site clean-up requirements orders from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three sites and we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. during the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. we remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. the progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future. in addition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities. future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly. as such, the costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may increase and could have a material adverse effect on us. environmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. for example, the european union (eu) and china are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. these regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. as regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. jurisdictions including the eu, australia, california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on energy star specifications, and the like, as well as additional energy consumption limits. certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. we incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the sec. in addition to the sec regulation, the eu, china and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. in addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections. in addition to our company, customers, governments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. while we have a human rights policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance with laws and expectations. our failure to satisfy customer expectations on forced and trafficked labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor’s product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges. in addition, many governments have enacted laws around pii, such as the gdpr and the ccpa, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. the gdpr imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. new emerging technology trends, such as ai, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. given the complexity and rapid development of ai, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of ai in products and services in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions such as the eu. for example, in the eu, an ai act is being considered. such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. we expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as ai will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. governments are also considering the new issues in intellectual property law that ai creates, which could result in different intellectual property rights in technology we create with ai and development processes and procedures and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers. there are evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters including those involving the environment and climate, energy and water consumption, diversity and inclusion, human rights and cybersecurity. this development on corporate responsibility is resulting in increased mandatory and voluntary reporting standards and disclosures. for example, various jurisdictions have adopted or are contemplating adopting legislation and regulations that may impact how we and our suppliers and customers conduct business or report on business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change-related risks and other sustainability matters related to our business. as the nature, scope and complexity of corporate responsibility reporting and disclosure requirements continue to evolve, we may incur additional compliance costs and indirect compliance costs from our customers and, suppliers that are passed on to us. in addition, certain corporate responsibility legislation and regulation may require us to adapt our business or supply chain in ways that are costly or inefficient. emerging legal and regulatory requirements, can be unpredictable, are subject to change, and may be difficult for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. our failure to comply, or the appearance of our failure to comply, with these legal and regulatory requirements can result in regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities, increase costs, and harm our reputation – any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. in addition, while we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or targets, among others) or commitments to improve our corporate responsibility profile and/or products or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives or achievement of such commitments may be costly, may not have the desired effect or may impact our reputation with other stakeholders and have a material adverse effect on our business.  we have publicly announced certain corporate responsibility goals spanning multiple topics informed by input from various of our stakeholders, including customers, investors and employees. these goals, which reflect our current plans and aspirations based on known conditions; thus, in the future they may change or may not be achieved. we may not achieve, for instance, our stated 30x25 energy efficiency goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency by 2025, for our processors and accelerators powering servers for high-performance computing and ai training from a 2020 baseline. we are also pursuing and annually reporting our progress toward a science-based target (aligned with a 1.5˚c scenario) of a 50% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2030, from a 2020 base year. our achievement of these goals, aspirations and other corporate responsibility initiatives is not certain and is subject to various challenges, risks and expectations such as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve or emerge. our progress towards some goals receive third-party limited assurance and not reasonable assurance, or may rely on receipt of others’ information and data that may not be subject to either third-party limited or reasonable assurance. any failure to achieve such goals (or achieve these goals within the set timeframe) or the perception by stakeholders of such failure to achieve these goals may result in reputational or financial harm. simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and sustainability-related matters. both advocates and opponents to these matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. to the extent we are subject to such activism or litigation, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. additionally, stakeholder groups may find our stated goals to be insufficiently responsive to the implications of issues, such as climate change, and any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet stakeholder expectations may result in loss of customers or in investors selling their shares, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business. issues related to the responsible use of ai may result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and liability. we offer products that include capabilities to support ai deployment and we expect this part of our business to grow. as with many new emerging technologies, ai presents risks and challenges and increasing ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption of ai, and thus our business. third-party misuse of ai applications, models, or solutions, or ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to individuals or society and impair the public’s acceptance of ai. moreover, we may be subject to competitive harm, regulatory action and legal liability as a result of new proposed legislation regulating ai, new applications of existing data protection, privacy and intellectual property and other laws. such regulations could cause us to incur greater compliance costs and could also impact our ability to sell or the ability of our customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our ai-related products and services, which could thus require us to change our business practices and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. if the ai-related products that we offer have unintended consequences or unintended usage or customization by our customers or are otherwise controversial due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues the public’s acceptance of ai may be impaired and may result in reputational and financial harm and liability to our business."
AMD,"merger, acquisition and integration risks acquisitions, joint ventures, and/or investments, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, may fail to materialize their anticipated benefits and could disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  we have acquired and invested in businesses, and may continue to do so, that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. acquisitions or joint ventures include numerous risks including our inability to identify suitable opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us; failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals or ip disputes or other litigation; difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all; or other unforeseen factors. even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits in a timely manner or at all for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes or operations and integrating and retaining the employees including key personnel of the acquired business; diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities, such as increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenants or other obligations; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; our inability to effectively retain suppliers, vendors and customers of the acquired businesses; entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no experience; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies’ financial reporting systems. any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  in addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, we may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. acquisitions or joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operation and other uses which could harm our business. for example, the majority of our atmp services are provided by the atmp jvs, and there is no guarantee that the jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. we may not realize the expected benefits from the thatic jv’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. in june 2019, the bis added certain chinese entities to the entity list, including thatic and the thatic jv. we are complying with u.s. law pertaining to the entity list designation.  furthermore, we may at times invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. many of the instruments that we invest in are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. to the extent any of the companies in which we invest in are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment."
AMD,"any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. we account for certain acquisitions, including the xilinx, inc. (xilinx) and pensando systems inc. (pensando) acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of asc 805, business combinations, with amd representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. we record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. in connection with the xilinx and pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. if, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. a decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill and may require us to record future impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations."
AMD,"liquidity and capital resources risks the agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the assumed xilinx notes, and our revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. the indenture governing our 3.924% senior notes due 2032 and 4.393% senior notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person. additionally, in connection with the acquisition of xilinx, we entered into supplemental indentures for the xilinx’s 2.950% notes and 2.375% notes (together, the assumed xilinx notes), pursuant to which all obligations of xilinx under the assumed xilinx notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. the indentures governing the assumed xilinx notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person. we also have an unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (revolving credit agreement). our revolving credit agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). in addition, our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. the agreement governing our convertible notes and our revolving credit agreement contains provisions whereby a payment default or acceleration under certain agreements with respect to other material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our convertible indenture or the revolving credit agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our revolving credit agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the revolving credit agreement to be immediately due and payable. if the lenders under our revolving credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings."
AMD,"our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. our total debt principal amount outstanding as of december 30, 2023 was $2.5 billion. our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.  we enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. we could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. also, our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the banking institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail. our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing.  in addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in accounts at certain banking institutions, and our deposits at these banking institutions may exceed insured limits. if a banking institution in which we hold funds fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds. any such loss or lack of access to these funds could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations. further, these events may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all."
AMD,"general risks our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we maintain operations around the world, including in the united states, canada, europe, australia, latin america and asia. we rely on third-party wafer foundries in the united states, europe and asia. nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in china, malaysia and taiwan. our shipping services are provided by third-party subcontractors. we also have international sales operations. international sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 65% for the year ended december 30, 2023. we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. the political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the u.s. and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with u.s. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act. recently, the u.s. and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against russia, belarus, and the dnr and lnr regions of ukraine, due to the conflict in ukraine. also, geopolitical changes between china and taiwan could disrupt the operations of our taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect delivery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. moreover, the ukraine-russia and israel-hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could have negative impacts on the global economy and financial markets. in addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, sea-level rise, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. for example, our santa clara and san jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california. we also have operations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and freezing. extreme weather events and natural disasters can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. in addition, certain natural disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business or the business of our suppliers or customers. global climate change also may result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. there may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as covid-19, avian influenza, measles or ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. we have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices.  the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. the consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the u.s. economy and worldwide financial markets.  any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in increased costs, shipment delays, general business interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business."
AMD,"we may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases. we license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. we report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. the occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry, especially in the areas of ai and machine learning, is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. if we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. to help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. in addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. our stock price is subject to volatility. our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. the trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. in addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. we have an approved stock repurchase program that authorizes repurchases of up to $12 billion of our common stock (repurchase program). as of december 30, 2023, $5.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program. the repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price."

NVDA,risk factors
NVDA,"risks related to our industry and markets failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards. our success depends on our ability to:  timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies;"
NVDA," develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development;  launch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions;  expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;  meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards;  manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction;  develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, customer support, e-commerce, ip licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and  complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities. we have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. if we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. they also do not guarantee revenue. failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. we cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. if we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. we have begun offering enterprise customers nvidia dgx cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying ai models, and nvidia ai foundations for customizable pretrained ai models. we have partnered with csps to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities. the timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. nvidia dgx cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. we also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including nvidia ai enterprise, nvidia omniverse, nvidia drive, and several other software solutions. these new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. we may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results. our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this annual report on form 10-k, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices for our products. some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive ip portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. these competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. for example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our ai cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. if we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue."
NVDA,"risks related to demand, supply and manufacturing failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. we use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. we are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. if our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. this mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. we build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. while we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient  commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. these risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties. this risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. in periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. we have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. we have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. if our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. we may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:"
NVDA," changes in product development cycles and time to market;  competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;  changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;  sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;  rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;  the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;  new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;  new or unexpected end-use cases;  increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;  business decisions made by third parties;  the demand for accelerated or ai-related cloud services, including our own software and nvidia dgx cloud services;  changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;  the demand for our products; or  government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage. demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. we have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. we may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. supply of hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. we expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our data center, professional visualization, and gaming products. we will have a broader and faster data center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of ai opportunities. the increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. we have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate  transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. while we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. as a result, the decisions made by our multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. if we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. if we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. if we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. in the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. we have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. we have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. these impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. the risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. all of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. we build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as nvidia dgx cloud services, nvidia ai foundations, omniverse platform, llms, and generative ai models. our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. recent technologies, such as generative ai models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for data center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative ai models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. additionally, we started shipping our cpu product offerings, the grace cpu and grace hopper superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. our ability to adequately predict our cpu demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. in addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving taiwan and china, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. the use of our gpus other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. for example, several years ago, our gaming gpus began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as ethereum. it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining. this has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our  gpus, which could negatively impact retail prices for our gpus and reduce demand for our new gpus. in general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. additionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. we also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as geforce now. failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand. dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. we depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. we do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. these subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. we face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:  lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;  failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;  failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;  failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;  limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers;  loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;  lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;  suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;  delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;  requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;  low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and  disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts. defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share. our hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. these risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. ai software products we or our partners offer rely on  training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by oems, odms, aibs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. an error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies. for example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain data center products. this defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. these costs could be significant in future periods. we recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. while we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. in general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results."
NVDA,"risks related to our global operating business adverse economic conditions may harm our business. economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on it infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:  increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;"
NVDA," increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;  decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;  the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;  limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;  the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on;  reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and  increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.  adverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations. additionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. a majority of our investment portfolio comprises usg securities. a decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the usg credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the u.s. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. these factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges. international sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. we sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the united states. our sales to china decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. although we have not received licenses from the usg to ship restricted products to china, we have started to ship alternatives to the china market in small volumes. china represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to usg licensing requirements and we expect china to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. these include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of ip and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events. product, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation. security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. additionally, some actors are using ai technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. we may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers. certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. we may also incorporate third-party data into our ai algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. these datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. we may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our ai algorithms. our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. in addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the  past and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business. to defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. we must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. while we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. these vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident. we hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. for example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our gfn service. breaches of our gfn security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose nvidia to potential litigation and liability. if we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. in addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business. business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel. our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to china, hong kong, israel, korea and taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. for example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the state of israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. in the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. we are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. we believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in israel. accordingly, some of our employees in israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business. additionally, interruptions or delays in services from csps, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services. climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our santa clara, california headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. our business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. new or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.  stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. we may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. we may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. we also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our gpus, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms. we may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. we have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. if we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. in addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been  harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. in addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. these companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. we face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring. additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:  difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;  assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;  integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;  coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;  stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;  potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;  the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;  the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;  negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;  exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and  impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers. for example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. these challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. sales to one customer, customer a, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the compute & networking segment. with several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. in the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple oems, odms, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through customer a, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the  compute & networking segment. if end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. the loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to u.s. or other countries’ trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success. our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls. we rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. the efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. we continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or erp, system. any erp system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. therefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:  our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;  our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;  our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;  our vendors' payment requirements;  unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and  changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards. any of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. for example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. these arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. in addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility."
NVDA,"risks related to regulatory, legal, our stock and other matters our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business. we are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, ip ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the foreign corrupt practices act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of ai; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. for example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. our position in markets relating to ai has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the european union, the united states, the united kingdom and china. for example, the french competition authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. we have also received requests for information from regulators in the european union, the united kingdom, and china regarding our sales of gpus, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative ai. if implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of u.s. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of u.s. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the u.s. department of commerce’s u.s. entity list or other usg restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. if we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the u.s. or similar applicable non-u.s. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. for example, in response to the war in ukraine, the united states and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into russia, belarus, and certain regions of ukraine. in fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to russia and closed business operations in russia. concurrently, the war in ukraine has impacted sales in emea and may continue to do so in the future. the increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of ai technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating ai and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. concerns regarding third-party use of ai for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of ai applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying llms. such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results. such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to ai technologies. as geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with ai, including gpus and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the u.s. and its allies. the united states has imposed unilateral controls restricting gpus and associated  products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to china, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as nvidia ai cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside china. export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside china and for our gaming products. the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including china, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. regulators in china have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the china market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our mellanox acquisition. if the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in china, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the usg announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting china’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. these restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to china (including hong kong and macau) and russia, and specifically impact our a100 and h100 integrated circuits, dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuits. the licensing requirements also apply to any future nvidia integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip i/o performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. there are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in china. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the usg also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the middle east. in october 2023, the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to china and country groups d1, d4, and d5 (including but not limited to, saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, and vietnam, but excluding israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including a100, a800, h100, h800, l4, l40, l40s and rtx 4090. the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, country group d5, including china. on october 23, 2023, the usg informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100, a800, h100, h800, and l40s products. we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to china. following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of china and hong kong. any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the usg does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. to the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. however, the licensing process is time-consuming. we have no assurance that the usg will grant such a license or that the usg will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. the usg is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. for example, the notified advanced computing, or “nac,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in china. the license process for exports to d1 and d4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside china. the requirements have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and already have disadvantaged and may in the future  disadvantage nvidia against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the usg’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the usg does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. even if the usg grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. the licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in china to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in china, europe, and israel. given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions, the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. in the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market, as well as other impacted markets, including the middle east. for example, the usg has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale gpu clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair gpus if certain system or use conditions are detected. the usg has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming gpus, and if the usg expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside china, including the u.s. and europe. export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from hong kong. export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter gpus may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our gpus. the usg may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside china and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain u.s. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than nvidia or other u.s. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. as a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in china, but also in other markets, such as europe, latin america, and southeast asia. excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in u.s. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. at the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by u.s. controls. additionally, restrictions imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our data center revenue. the chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. for example, the chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by micron, a supplier of ours. further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results. finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in taiwan. any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results. increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us. shareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. further, there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the u.s. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder,  regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards. we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. these factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability."
NVDA,"issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including ai in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability. concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as ai, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. we are increasingly building ai capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone ai applications. ai poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as ai solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of ai models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to ai could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of ai, including in jurisdictions such as the european union as well as under any u.s. regulation adopted in response to the biden administration’s executive order on ai, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. for example, regulation adopted in response to the executive order on ai could require us to notify the usg of certain safety test results and other information. furthermore, changes in ai-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of ai by us or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm. actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other ip rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. we may commence legal proceedings to protect our ip rights, which may increase our operating expenses. we could be subject to countersuits as a result. if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s ip, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s ip rights. if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. we rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our ip. foreign laws may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as united states law. this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. we also may face risks to our ip if our employees are hired by competitors. we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable. we are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. these areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. we process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard  to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in ai, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. the theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims. in the united states, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. in the past few years, numerous u.s. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. as applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. the exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. these state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018, as amended by the california privacy rights act of 2020, or cpra, or collectively the ccpa, gives california residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. the ccpa provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. if we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.  worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. the european union adopted the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, and the united kingdom similarly adopted the u.k. gdpr, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the european economic area, or eea, and the united kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. if we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. furthermore, the eu ai act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices. in the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from europe, china, and other jurisdictions to the united states or other countries. certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. for example, the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the eea. the european commission released a set of “standard contractual clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the eea to jurisdictions that the european commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the united states. additionally, the u.k.’s international data transfer agreement / addendum, as well as the eu-u.s. data privacy framework and the u.k. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant u.s.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the eea and u.k. to the united states. however, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the united states. other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. for example, china’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. data broadly defined as important under china’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of china without prior assessment and approval by the cyberspace administration of china, or cac. compliance with these requirements, including cac assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in china or impact our ability to transfer data outside of china. the inability to import personal data to the united states could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to european, china and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. some european regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of europe for allegedly violating the gdpr’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business. we may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. for example, certain privacy laws, such as the gdpr and the ccpa, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. we sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. we publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences. data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. these obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with such obligations. if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition. we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors. we are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows. further, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. most of our income is taxable in the united states, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or fdii. if u.s. tax rates increase or the fdii deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. in addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and pillar two model rules announced by the organization for economic cooperation and development, or oecd. these and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition. our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. a decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. we currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. for example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in 2017 and 2018. litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. as of january 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. as each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. if we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. we also have a $575 million commercial paper program. maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business. our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared  immediately due and payable. changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing. delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. under our agreement with microsoft for the xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. these provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire."
BASE,"item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. the last day of our fiscal year is january 31. our fiscal years ended january 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are referred to herein as fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. risks related to our industry and business we have a history of net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the future. we incurred net losses of $80.2 million, $68.5 million and $58.2 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of january 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $490.7 million. we intend to continue investing significant resources to further develop our platform and expand our sales, marketing, operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently at a rate that exceeds the rate of increase in our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability."
BASE,"we may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates. our historical revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics or key business metrics growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. our revenue was $180.0 million, $154.8 million and $123.5 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods and we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate. our revenue growth rate may be impacted by a number of factors, including slowing adoption of or demand for our products and services, increasing competition, decreasing growth of our overall market, changes to technology or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, among others. if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we have experienced strong growth in our employee headcount, geographic reach and operations, and we expect to continue to grow in the future. managing our growth effectively and integrating new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue expanding our operational and financial infrastructure while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. continued growth could challenge our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel, maintain customer satisfaction and manage our costs and operating expenses. further, as our customers adopt our products and services for an increasing number of use cases, we have had to support more complex commercial relationships. we must continue to improve and expand our information technology (“it”), and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and relationships with various partners and other third parties. in addition, we operate globally and have established numerous international subsidiaries. plans to continue doing so will place additional demands on our resources and operations. if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our products and services and the efficiency of our operations could suffer. this could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. the database software market in which we operate is competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements and industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. many established businesses aggressively compete against us and have offerings with functionalities similar to those of our products and services. these competing offerings may also be complementary with ours and customers often deploy our platform alongside a competitor’s product. we primarily compete with established legacy database providers, such as oracle, ibm and microsoft, providers of nosql database offerings, such as mongodb, and cloud infrastructure providers with database functionalities, such as amazon, microsoft and google. in the future, other large software and internet companies with substantial resources, customers and brand power may also seek to enter our market. we would expect competition to increase with the entry of new companies and the introduction of innovative technologies. many of our existing and potential competitors have or could have, substantial competitive advantages, including but not limited to:  greater name recognition and longer operating histories;  broader distribution and established relationships with partners, customers and application developer communities;  greater financial resources for sales and marketing, acquisitions and entering into strategic partnerships;  competitive pricing and greater professional services and customer support resources;  lower labor, research and development costs; and  more mature intellectual property rights portfolios. if we fail to compete effectively with respect to any of these competitive advantages, we may weaken our competitive position, fail to attract new customers or lose or fail to renew existing customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we expect competition to increase with the entry of new companies and the introduction of innovative technologies. potential customers may believe that substitute technologies or ancillary solutions that address narrower segments overall are adequate for their needs. further, we have made portions of our source code available on an open source and source available basis and face risks if others compete effectively using our code. additionally, some of our current or potential competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish cooperative relationships, among themselves or with others, that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive offerings than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their offerings, including those that may incorporate ai, more quickly than we do. if we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to competitive challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  we may fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or obtain renewals, upgrades or expansions from our existing customers, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. attracting and retaining sales and marketing personnel, developing partner relationships and raising awareness of our platform, including leveraging community edition and free trials, are critical for customer acquisition, and failure to cost-effectively acquire new customers could negatively impact our growth.  our success depends, in part, on retaining existing customers through subscription renewals and expanding relationships, including broadening customers' use cases within our products and adopting additional couchbase products and services. the non-cancelable term of our subscriptions are typically one to three years but may be longer or shorter in limited circumstances, and renewals or upgrades are not guaranteed. in addition, renewals might not have a similar contract period or differ in price, terms or capacity, or customers may decide to otherwise downgrade their subscriptions. for example, the impact of the macroeconomic environment has caused, and may in the future continue to cause, certain customers to request concessions including extended payment terms or better pricing, increased customer churn, a lengthening of our sales cycles with prospective customers, a delay of planned projects or expansions and reduced contract values with certain prospective and existing customers. retention may fluctuate due to factors including our customers’  satisfaction with our products and services, our licensing models, the prices, features or perceived value of competing offerings, changes to our offerings or general economic conditions, among other things.  additionally, our success depends, in part, on our determination of which product features to include in our free versus paid versions of our products (which we call the community edition and enterprise edition, respectively, for our server and mobile suite of products) including the timing of when to incorporate enterprise edition features into our community edition products. any failure on our part to determine the correct balance and timing may adversely affect our business. existing or potential customers may determine that the functionality of our free versions is sufficient for their needs and as a result may not convert from the use of our community edition or free trials to a paid product or downgrade from our paid products. further, users of our enterprise edition server and mobile products may violate our license terms by using our product without paying for a required subscription or by exceeding their subscription entitlements, and we may not always be able to determine when this occurs or enforce our license terms. in addition, expanding our customer base in new industry verticals depends on effective organization, focus and training of our sales and marketing personnel, efficient pricing and product strategies and educating the enterprise architects and application developers in such industries about the benefits and features of our products and services. inadequate returns on sales and marketing efforts and investments may harm our business. the market for our products and services is relatively new and evolving, and our future success depends on the growth and expansion of this market. it is uncertain whether the market for our products and services will continue to grow, how rapidly it will grow, or whether our products and services will be more widely adopted. our success will depend, in part, on market acceptance and the widespread adoption of our products and services as an alternative to legacy or other offerings and the selection of our products and services over competing offerings that may have similar functionality. technologies related to database offerings are still evolving and we cannot predict market acceptance of our products and services or the development of other competing offerings based on entirely new technologies. for example, we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from subscriptions for, and services related to couchbase server and couchbase mobile. demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including continued market acceptance by existing customers and potential customers, the ability to expand the product for different use cases, the timing of development and releases of new offerings by our competitors, technological change and the growth or contraction in the market in which we compete. it is possible that customer adoption of our new products, such as couchbase capella, may replace a portion of customer spend on our existing products. if the market for database solutions, and for nosql database solutions in particular, does not continue to grow as expected, or if we are unable to continue to efficiently and effectively respond to the rapidly evolving trends and meet the demands of our customers, achieve more widespread market awareness and adoption of our products and services or otherwise manage the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services, our competitive position would weaken and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected. if we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies or other market requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. our ability to attract new customers and expand our relationship with our existing customers depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance and improve our products and services, introduce compelling new features, address additional use cases, and develop features that reflect the constantly evolving nature of technology, regulations, and our customers’ needs. the success of any new or enhanced product or service features depends on several factors, including our anticipation of market changes and market demand, timely completion and delivery, adequate quality testing, integration with existing technologies and applications and competitive pricing. if our investments in new products and services, including couchbase capella, are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, applications, data and devices, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in such systems. we may not be successful in developing these modifications and enhancements. the addition of new features and solutions to our products and services may increase our research and development expenses, compliance, personnel. security, infrastructure and other expenses. we have adopted new features and may introduce others in the future, which may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue to justify the related research and development and other related expenses. it is difficult to predict customer adoption of new features. such uncertainty limits our ability to forecast our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of challenges, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. if we are unable to  manage the risks associated with the development of new products and features, our business would be adversely affected. if new technologies emerge that enable others to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively. generally, our professional services and training revenues have grown as our subscription revenue has grown. we believe our investment in services facilitates the adoption of our products. however, couchbase capella contains a service component and couchbase capella customers may not require standalone services at the same rate as for our enterprise server and mobile offerings. as a result, as customers migrate to couchbase capella, it is not clear if revenue from our services business will continue to grow at rates consistent with prior periods. further, professional services and training may be seen as ancillary to our core product offerings. to the extent customers reduce spending due to macroeconomic conditions, customers may opt out of services, which may harm our results of operations.  we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations. we were formed in 2011 with the merger of membase, inc. and couchone, inc. since our formation, we have frequently expanded our product features and services and evolved our pricing methodologies. our limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. these risks and challenges include, among other things, our ability to manage our costs, accurately forecast revenue, gain new customers, retain or expand existing customers, introduce successful products, services and features and compete effectively.  if we fail to address the risks and challenges that we face, including those above as well as those described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section, our business, financial condition, results of operations, key business metrics and prospects could be adversely affected. further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. we have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our future results of operations and key business metrics may fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our results of operations and key business metrics may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:  market acceptance and demand for our products and services, including new products and services;  the quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan;  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;  the length of our sales cycle, including the timing of renewals;  our ability to attract new customers, particularly large enterprises;  our ability to retain customers and expand their adoption of our products and services, particularly our largest customers;  our ability to successfully expand internationally and penetrate key markets;  a failure to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers with certain of our products;  technological changes and the timing and success of new or enhanced product features by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market;  our product mix and the revenue recognition related to such products;  changes in the average contract term or the timing of revenue recognition, any of which may impact implied growth rates;  changes to our packaging and licensing models, which may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized;  increases in and the timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow our operations and to remain competitive;  pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise;  seasonal buying patterns;  the implementation of cost-saving activities, extra layers of scrutiny and approval, and customers electing to buy in smaller increments as a result of macroeconomic conditions;   the impact and costs related to the acquisition and integration of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property rights;  an inability to enforce our licenses associated with our products;  our ability to successfully hire and retain employees and key members of our management team;  changes in the legislative, litigation or regulatory environment; and  general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, including geopolitical uncertainty and instability, as well as the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations. any one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. we also intend to continue to invest significantly to grow our business in the near future. in addition, we generally experience seasonality based on when we enter into agreements with customers, and our quarterly results of operations generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customer buying habits. this seasonality is reflected to a lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in revenue, due to the fact that a substantial portion of our subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, which typically ranges from one to three years. we expect that seasonality will continue to affect our results of operations in the future. the variability of our results of operations or other operating estimates could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; if so, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. we recognize a significant portion of revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, and as a result, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations. subscription revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 95%, 92% and 94% of total revenue for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. sales of new or renewal subscriptions may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers satisfaction, pricing, the prices of competitors’ products and reductions in our customers’ spending levels or fluctuations in customer usage of consumption-based offerings. if sales decline or if consumption-based customers consume couchbase capella at a slower rate than expected, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline.  under most of our contracts, we recognize a portion of subscription revenue upon transfer of the software license to the customer and the larger remainder of the transaction price ratably over the term of the arrangement. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for more information. as we significantly rely on subscription revenue, a significant portion of the revenue that we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into in prior periods. consequently, a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period and any downturn in sales, demand or market acceptance for our products may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations for such period but in future periods. our subscription-based products also make it difficult to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as a significant portion of such revenue from customers will be recognized over the term of the applicable agreement. further, we intend to increase our investment in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. these costs are generally expensed as incurred, in contrast to our revenue. accordingly, we may recognize the costs associated with such increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we depend on our sales force, and we may fail to attract, retain, motivate or train our sales force, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our sales force obtains new customers and drives additional sales to existing customers. our hiring, training and retention efforts have been, and may further be, hindered as a result of the intense competition for talent. new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and our remote and online onboarding and training processes may be less effective or efficient than in-person training and take longer. further, hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional set up and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. if we are unable to attract, retain, motivate and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our sales personnel do not reach significant levels of productivity in a timely manner or our sales personnel are not successful in bringing potential customers into the pipeline, converting them into new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. our sales strategy to target larger enterprises involves risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to smaller enterprises, such as long and unpredictable sales cycles and sales efforts that require considerable time and expense, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment. sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller customers, such as longer and unpredictable sales cycles, more complex customer requirements and processes, substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales. these risks may be enhanced in the current macroeconomic environment. a number of factors influence the length and variability of our sales cycles, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes and the size of the customer. for example, large customers often require proof of concept deployments, free trials or begin to deploy our products on a limited basis but nevertheless negotiate pricing discounts, which all increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that sales to these customers will justify our substantial upfront investment. large customer sales have, in some cases, occurred in periods subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all, the result of which could affect our cash flows and results of operations for that fiscal period and for future periods.  if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among enterprise architects, application developers and other key functions that support them, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and our reputation as a leader in the market for database solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to foster awareness among enterprise architects, application developers and other key functions that support them, our ability to continue to develop high-quality products and services, our ability to successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, our ability to maintain the reputation of our products and services for data security and our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights. our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry analysts often provide reports of our products and services, as well as the offerings of our competitors, and perception of our products and services in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reports. negative reports, or reports that are less positive as compared to those of our competitors, may adversely affect our reputation and brand. additionally, the performance of our partners may affect our reputation and brand if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners. our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks and our competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours leading to market confusion. if we are otherwise unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. the maintenance and promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, yet may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue from such brand promotion initiatives may not offset the increased expenses we incur. if so, we may have reduced pricing power relative to our competitors, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products or interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure could adversely affect our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. our products are complex, and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. our products are used in it environments with different operating systems, system management software, applications, devices, databases, servers, storage, middleware, custom and third-party applications and equipment and networking configurations. this diversity increases the likelihood of errors or failures in the it environments into which our products are deployed. additionally, we rely upon third-party cloud hosting infrastructure providers to host our cloud offering. despite testing by us, real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our customer solutions, software or technology or the technology or software we license from third parties, including open source software, may not be found until our customers use our products. this could result in negative publicity, security related incidents such as data breaches, data loss, unavailability or corruption, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, harm to our brand, weakening of our competitive position or complaints or claims by customers for losses sustained by them or our failure to meet the stated service level commitments in our customer agreements. in such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend significant additional resources in order to help correct the problem. any errors, failures or bugs in our products could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers or expand their use of our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. for certain of our products, our success depends, in part, on the ability of our existing customers and potential customers to access such products at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. we may experience service disruptions, outages, capacity constraints and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes or failures, human or software errors, malicious acts, terrorism, denial of service attacks or other security related incidents or capacity constraints. in some instances, we may not be able to identify or remedy the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our products and customer implementations become more complex. if our products are unavailable or if our customers are unable to access our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, or if other performance problems occur, we may experience a loss of customers, lost or delayed market acceptance of our platform and services, delays in payment to us by customers, injury to our reputation and brand, legal claims against us and the diversion of our resources. the foregoing risks associated with any outage or service disruptions are magnified by the fact that our platform is typically used by our customers to support mission-critical applications. in addition, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. some of our customer contracts contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding response times for support, performance of our products and availability of our services. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our products and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our products or services, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits or potentially face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts related to unused subscriptions. if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our contracts with our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our ability to maintain and increase sales with our existing customers depends, in part, on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to offer high-quality support would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. our ability to provide effective support is vital to our business as our products are often utilized by our customers for mission-critical applications and are often integrated with and dependent on other core technologies, which factors also increase the complexity and challenge of providing support. if we do not succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing education related to our products, our reputation could be harmed, and our existing customers may not renew or expand their use of our products. to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate customer support personnel, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our customers and our customers’ satisfaction with our products, would be adversely affected. our failure to provide and maintain high-quality customer support would harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our international operations and planned continued international expansion subject us to additional costs and risks, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our continued success and our growth strategy depend, in part, on our planned continued international expansion. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but such efforts may not be successful and are subject to a number of risks, including, without limitation:  greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and managing collections in countries where our recourse may be more limited, as well as longer collection periods;  higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;  differing labor regulations, especially in the european union (“eu”) where labor laws may be and often are more favorable to employees;  challenges inherent to efficiently recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture and employee programs across all of our offices;  fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business;  management communication and integration problems resulting from language and cultural differences and geographic dispersion;  costs associated with language localization of our products and services;  risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification and localization of our products and services that may be required in foreign countries;  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and tax laws, trade laws, export quotas, customs duties, treaties and other trade restrictions;  costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including, but not limited to laws and regulations governing our corporate governance, product licenses, data privacy, data protection and data security regulations, particularly in the eu;  compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (the “fcpa”), the u.s. travel act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties and collateral consequences for us;  risks relating to the implementation of exchange controls, including restrictions promulgated by the office of foreign assets control (“ofac”) and other similar trade protection regulations and measures;  heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial condition and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;  the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, particularly, those countries where we operate through a professional employer organization and do not have a direct contractual relationship with our service providers in such countries;  exposure to regional or global public health issues and restrictions on travel or other measures undertaken by governments in response;   general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets, including inflation concerns, rising interest rates, political and economic instability in some countries, such as the hamas-israel or russia-ukraine conflicts, and any related political or economic response and counter responses or otherwise by various global actors or general effect on the global economy;  foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the united states; and  double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the united states or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. if we are unable to address these or other problems encountered in connection with our international operations and expansion, our operations may be negatively impacted. some of our business partners also have international operations  and are subject to the risks described above. these and other factors could harm our ability to generate revenue outside of the united states and, consequently, adversely affect our business. in addition, compliance with evolving foreign regulations may increase operational costs. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have adverse effects on our business. in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or u.s. regulations applicable to us. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, partners and third-party service providers will comply with these laws and policies. violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, partners or third-party service providers could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we track certain key business metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. certain of these metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation. we track certain metrics, including arr, dollar-based net retention rate and number of customers, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party, and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies or the assumptions on which we rely. our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. in addition, our arr and dollar-based net retention rate calculations assume our customers will renew unless we receive notification of non-renewal and are no longer in negotiations prior to a measurement date, and will not increase or reduce, their subscriptions for our platform and services. if these assumptions are incorrect, our actual arr and dollar-based net retention rate may differ significantly from the metrics presented in this annual report on form 10-k. if the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics. limitations or errors with respect to the data or how we measure data may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. if our key business metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our key business metrics to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. we depend on our management team and other highly skilled personnel, and we may fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate highly skilled personnel, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on the continued contributions of our management team, key employees and other highly skilled personnel. most of our management team and key employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their relationship with us at any time. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products. the competition for top management, engineering talent and other highly skilled personnel is high, and the loss of their services or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly within our research and development and engineering organizations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success also depends, in part, on continuing to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. competition for these personnel in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters are located, and in other locations, is intense, and our industry faces significant competition for skilled personnel. additionally, the former employers of our new employees have, and in the future may, assert that our new employees or we have breached legal obligations, which may be time-consuming, distracting to management and may divert our resources. current and potential personnel also often consider the value of equity awards they receive in connection with their employment, and if the perceived value of our equity awards declines relative to those of our competitors, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel may be harmed. if we fail to attract and integrate new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed. we believe that our company culture, which promotes being valued and creating value, has been critical to our success. we face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:  ability to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;  the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;  the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; and  the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions. if we are not able to maintain our culture, our business could be adversely affected. we may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances, debt instruments and cash generated from our operations. to support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our products and services. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. we evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to grow and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited and our business could be adversely affected. future debt obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. we maintain a revolving line of credit (the “credit facility”) with mufg bank ltd. (“mufg”). our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for any indebtedness, and maintain compliance with covenants as part of our agreement with mufg, is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this “risk factors” section. in the event we draw on the credit facility or otherwise incur indebtedness, our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could:  require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities;  limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements;  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to create or incur certain liens;  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and  increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness. there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. we may also need to refinance a portion of any of our outstanding indebtedness as it matures. there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt, including the credit facility, or that the terms may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. we may be unable to make acquisitions and investments or successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business, and our acquisitions and investments may not meet our expectations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may in the future acquire or invest in businesses, offerings, technologies or talent that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. however, we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments. due to inherent risks, including, without limitation:  unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition, including claims related to the acquired company, its offerings or technology, or potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses that are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process;  incurrence of acquisition-related expenses, including those related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated, which would be recognized as a current period expense;  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;  challenges with incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand;  inability to identify security vulnerabilities in acquired technology prior to integration with our technology and products and services;  inability to achieve anticipated synergies or unanticipated difficulty with integration into our corporate culture;  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;  the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies;  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;  harm to our existing business relationships with partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;  potential loss of key employees;  use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources;  inability to recognize acquired deferred revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and acquisitions also require the use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition. each of these could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. the use of cash to finance any future acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including the retirement of outstanding indebtedness. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. we may have to delay or forego a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary financing to complete such acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. use of ai, including in our products and services, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business. we are developing and have launched new product features that use ai technologies, including, for example, capella iq, our generative ai coding assistant. ai technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. we may be unsuccessful in developing, integrating or maintaining product features using ai technologies that gain market traction, or in doing so in a cost-effective manner. the introduction of ai into our products, or the use of our products as part of ai technologies and applications, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, intellectual property risks,  confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns or other complications that could harm our business, reputation or financial condition. further, our use of ai tools and technologies may require additional investment and development of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of our data, including customer data processed by us, with ai technologies in our product offerings or our tools. ai may create content that appears correct but is inaccurate or flawed, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability if we, our customers or others rely on or use this flawed content to their detriment.  our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns. prolonged economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and key business metrics. negative conditions in the general economy in either the united states or abroad, including inflation and rising interest rate concerns, conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in economic policy, trade uncertainty including changes in tariffs, sanctions, international treaties and other trade restrictions, the occurrence of a natural disaster, global public health crisis or armed conflicts, could continue to cause a decrease in corporate spending on it offerings in general and negatively affect the growth of our business. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry or geography.  these conditions could make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately and could cause our customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our products and services, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. in the current macroeconomic environment, we continue to see longer deal cycles, extra layers of scrutiny and approval, and customers electing to buy in smaller increments. further, during challenging economic times, our customers may face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us, if at all. if that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our results of operations. a substantial downturn in any of the industries in which our customers operate may cause firms to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on it offerings. customers in these industries may delay or cancel projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. to the extent subscriptions to our products or expenditures on our services are perceived by existing customers or potential customers to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general it spending. we face fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent we continue to expand internationally, we will become more exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies increases the real cost of our products and services for our customers outside of the united states, which could lead to the lengthening of our sales cycles or reduced demand for our products and services. additionally, increased international sales may result in foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. moreover, such continued expansion would increase operating expenses incurred outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies. to date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our business could be adversely affected by pandemics, natural disasters, political crises or other unexpected events. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or flood, or a significant power outage or telecommunications failure, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, the internet or the operations of our third-party service and technology providers. in particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity and wildfires. in addition, any unforeseen public health crises, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability or other catastrophic events, whether in the united states or abroad, including the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts and any related political or economic response and counter  responses or otherwise by various global actors or general effect on the global economy, can continue to adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. the impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could result in decreased demand for our products and services or a delay in the provision of our products and services or could negatively impact consumer and business spending in the impacted regions or globally depending on the severity, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. all of the aforementioned risks would be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate."
BASE,"risks related to our dependence on third parties if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. we employ a go-to-market business model whereby a portion of our revenue is generated by sales through or with our partners, including csps, independent software vendors, systems integrators, technology partners, original equipment manufacturers, marketplaces, managed service providers and resellers, that further expand the reach of our direct sales force into additional geographies, sectors, industries and channels. we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into reseller relationships in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. we provide certain partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products and services, but our efforts to provide training and build relationships may be ineffective. in addition, if our partners are unsuccessful in marketing and selling our products and services, it would limit our planned expansion into certain geographies, sectors, industries and channels. if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our partners, we may not be able to successfully incentivize these partners to sell our products and services to customers. some of our partners may also market, sell and support offerings that are competitive with ours, may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive offerings, may have incentives to promote our competitors’ offerings to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products and services altogether. our partners could also subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our partners misrepresents the functionality of our products and services to customers, violate laws or violate our or their corporate policies. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners, identifying additional partners and training our partners to independently sell our products and services. any shortcomings of the foregoing by us or our partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects."
BASE,"we rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, and any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business. our success depends, in part, on our relationships with third-party service providers, including providers of cloud hosting infrastructure, customer relationship management systems, financial reporting systems, human resource management systems, credit card processing platforms, marketing automation systems, payroll processing systems and data centers, among others. in particular, cloud hosting infrastructure is becoming increasingly important as customers adopt couchbase capella. if any of these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, temporarily or permanently cease operations, face financial distress or other business disruptions or increase their fees, or if our relationships with any of these providers deteriorate or if any of the agreements we have entered into with such third parties are terminated or not renewed without adequate transition arrangements, or if we are unsuccessful in managing or negotiating cost-effective relationships with them, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide customers with our products and services, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, receipt of payments from customers may be delayed, our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened or our business operations could be disrupted. any of such disruptions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows until we replace such providers or develop replacement technology or operations.  certain estimates and information we refer to publicly are based on information from third-party sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources or the  methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and information may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. certain estimates and information we refer to publicly, including general expectations concerning our industry and the market in which we operate and market size, are based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. this information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or the methodologies for collecting such data. if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover limitations or material inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected."
BASE,"risks related to our open source and intellectual property our use of third-party open source software in our solutions, the availability of core portions of our source code on an open source or source available basis and contributions to our open source projects could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and provide our services, subject us to possible litigation and allow third parties to access and use software and technology that we use in our business, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our products include software that is licensed to us by third parties under “open source” licenses. use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, because open source projects may have vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, and also because open source licensors generally provide their software on an “as-is” basis and do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code even though our customers may insist on such protections in our contracts with them. we have historically elected to make core portions of our source code available on an open source basis to facilitate adoption as well as collaboration and participation from our application developer communities. however, we may not be successful in this strategy, and our move toward source-available licensing, as well as the continued availability of our source code, may enable others to compete more effectively against us. in addition, the public availability of the source code for such software may make it easier for others to compromise our products. we expect to continue to incorporate such open source software in our products and allow core portions of our source code to be available on an open source or source-available basis in the future.  although most of our code is developed in-house, we also receive a limited amount of contributions from our open source developer communities. we require third parties who provide contributions to us to assign ownership of all intellectual property rights in their contributions to us, or provide us with a perpetual license to their works, and represent that their contributions are original works and that they are entitled to assign or license these rights to us. however, we cannot be sure that we can use all contributions without obtaining additional licenses from third parties, and may be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims as a result of our use of these contributions. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. we seek to ensure that our closed-source proprietary software is not combined with, and does not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require the release of the source code of our closed-source proprietary software to the public. however, we cannot ensure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. if we are held to have failed to comply with the terms of applicable licenses or our current policies and procedures or otherwise combine our closed-source proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our closed-source proprietary software to the public at no cost under the terms of applicable open source licenses. this would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages.  additionally, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. or foreign courts, and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products. from time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. as a result, we and our customers could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with applicable license conditions, or if we are required to defend a customer in the event of such a claim, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses  defending against such allegations. if we are unable to successfully defend against such allegations we could be subject to significant damages or other liability, including being enjoined from the sale of our products and services. we could also be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue providing our products on terms that are not economically feasible, re-engineer our products, discontinue or delay the provision of our products if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code. any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
BASE,"our distribution and licensing model could negatively affect our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights. many of our products are available for free on the internet, including a substantial portion of our source code on open source or source available terms. also, we may have limited or no direct visibility into who may be using our software or to what extent or purpose, so our ability to detect violations of our product licenses is extremely limited. if we are unable to manage the risks related to our licensing and distribution model, our business could be adversely affected. additionally, we have adopted bsl 1.1, a source-available license, for certain of our publicly available source code. we believe bsl 1.1 enables us to fairly and transparently control commercialization of our source code, however such licensing strategy may not prevent misuse of our source code. additionally, bsl 1.1 is not an open source license, which may negatively impact adoption of the source code, reduce our brand and product awareness and negatively impact our ability to compete.  because of the rights accorded to third parties under open source licenses, there may be fewer technology barriers to entry in the markets in which we compete and it may be relatively easy for new and existing competitors, some of whom may have greater resources than we have, to compete with us. open source software license terms generally allow liberal modifications and distribution of the code. we have historically elected to make core portions of our source code available on an open source basis. the continued availability of our source code, notwithstanding our move toward source-available licensing, among other things, may enable others to develop new software products or services that are competitive to ours without the same degree of overhead and lead time required by us, particularly if customers do not value the differentiation of our proprietary components. it is possible for new and existing competitors, including those with greater resources than ours, to develop their own open source software or hybrid proprietary and open source software offerings. in addition, some competitors make open source software available for free download or use or may position competing open source software as a loss leader. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure or the availability of open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which could adversely affect our business. our use of open source software may also limit our ability to assert certain of our intellectual property and proprietary rights against third parties, including competitors, who access or use software or technology that we have contributed to such open source projects. we could incur substantial costs in obtaining, maintaining, protecting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights and any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our software and brand. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how and our brand. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, other intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions in an effort to establish and protect our proprietary rights. however, the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights may be inadequate if, for example, we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and as a result our competitors might gain access to our proprietary technology and develop and commercialize similar or substantially identical products, services or technologies, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be adversely affected. while we have patent applications pending in the united states, there can be no assurance that they will result in issued patents. as of january 31, 2024, we owned five issued u.s. patents, nine u.s. non-provisional patent applications, two u.s. provisional patent applications, two patent cooperation treaty, or pct, patent applications, and three foreign patent applications. pending pct patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file national stage patent applications within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. if we do not timely file such national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our pct patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such applications. even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our technology. in addition, any patents issued or licensed to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expenses. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated or held unenforceable through administrative process, including re-examination, inter partes review, interference and derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions or litigation in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions. others may infringe on our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, independently develop similar, substantially identical or superior offerings, duplicate any of our offerings or design around our patents or other intellectual property rights or use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. further, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. various courts, including the united states supreme court, have rendered decisions that affect the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to software and business methods. these decisions state, among other things, that a patent claim that recites an abstract idea, natural phenomenon or law of nature are not themselves patentable. precisely what constitutes a law of nature or abstract idea is uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of our technology could be considered abstract ideas. accordingly, the evolving case law in the united states may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any future owned or licensed patents. as we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our services and platform capabilities and proprietary information will likely increase. intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available, or the laws of or mechanisms for enforcement in some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states. policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property may thus be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. in addition, we have made core portions of our own software available under open source or source-available licenses, and we include third-party open source software in our products. we have also occasionally contributed source code to open source projects. because the source code for any software we distribute under open source or source-available licenses or contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such source code may be limited or lost entirely. we protect and rely, in part, on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. while we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties, including suppliers, vendors and the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. additionally, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have created or developed intellectual property on our behalf or had access to our proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets. we cannot guarantee that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets. further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing offerings that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. we may not have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements. further, we have experienced and may in the future experience unauthorized access of our proprietary source code, confidential information and know-how. we have and may in the future initiate litigation regarding trade secret misappropriation, but enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or know-how is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. in addition, some courts in and outside the united states are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets and know-how. we may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or impossible to detect. any litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights that, if successful, could cost us valuable intellectual property rights. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of enhancements to our products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products or harm our reputation and brand. in addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new  product features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and would adversely affect our ability to compete. we have been and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes which may be costly to defend, subject us to significant liability, require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to use certain technologies. we have been and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes. our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. however, we may not be aware if our products are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights, and such third parties may bring claims alleging such infringement, misappropriation or violation. further, we have faced and may in the future face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the software or derivative works that we have developed, including works using third-party open source software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. in addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwise obtained. many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. certain of our agreements with our customers and other third parties include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights. any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, against us or for which we are required to provide indemnification, are time consuming, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. we may be required to make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement fees, damages (including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s rights), royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us and we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that cause us to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or violate, including subscriptions to our products. we may also agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our products or a portion thereof, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. with respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. if a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected product features), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management. moreover, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it would have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. we expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for platform and services grows. accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources."
BASE,"risks related to our legal and regulatory environment our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including for data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, intellectual property, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, immigration laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. further, emerging tools and technologies we may utilize in our products and services, like ai, may become subject to regulation under new laws or new applications of existing laws. in certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states. these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, noncompliance with which could subject us to:"
BASE," investigations, enforcement actions, orders and sanctions;  mandatory changes to our products and services;  disgorgement of profits, fines and damages;  civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;  claims for damages by our customers or partners;  termination of contracts;  loss of intellectual property rights; and  temporary or permanent debarment from sales to heavily regulated organizations and governments. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, enforcement actions are taken, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.  in addition, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, including u.s. federal, state and local governmental organizations when selling our product to them directly or through partners, which affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our partners could subject us to investigations, fines, suspension or debarment from future government or other contracting opportunities and other penalties, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.  if our security measures, or those of our service providers or customers, are breached or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our or our customers’ data or software, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or terminate their use of our products and services and we may face claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability and reputational damage. we collect, use, store and transmit or otherwise process data as part of our business operations, including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions. we also use third-party service providers to collect, use, store, transmit, maintain and otherwise process such information. increasingly, threats from computer malware, ransomware, viruses, social engineering (including phishing attacks), denial of service or other attacks, employee theft or misuse and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry and our customers’ industries. any of these security incidents could result in unauthorized access or damage to, or disablement, encryption, use, disclosure, modification, destruction, loss or other processing of, our data or customer data (including personal data), software or systems or disrupt our ability to provide our products and services. any actual or perceived security incident could interrupt our operations, harm our reputation and brand, result in significant remediation and cybersecurity protection costs (including deploying additional personnel and modifying or enhancing our protection technologies and investigating and remediating any information security vulnerabilities), result in lost revenue, lead to regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, disputes, indemnity obligations, damages for breach of contract, penalties for violations of law or regulation and other legal risks, increase our insurance premiums, result in any other financial exposure, lead to loss of customer confidence in us or decreased use of our products and services and otherwise adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, business, financial condition and results of operations. we have taken steps to protect the data on our systems and offerings, but our security measures or those of our customers or third-party service providers could be insufficient and breached as a result of third-party action, employee or user errors, technological limitations, defects or vulnerabilities in our systems or offerings or those of our third-party service providers, malfeasance, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, including state-sponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources, or from failure in technological resources, failure to comply with policies or otherwise. we have experienced and may continue to experience security incidents and attacks of varying types and degrees, including instances where our third-party providers have been impacted by a supply-chain attack and instances where there has been exposure and unauthorized use of credentials of our personnel. in addition, we have identified and been required to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities in our code and in third-party code. we could be impacted by these and other security incidents and vulnerabilities in the future, and our internal controls and operations regarding security may not be effective in eliminating the risk of compromise of our systems, data and software. additionally, with our employees and many employees of our third-party service providers working remotely, we may be exposed to increased risks of security breaches or incidents. for example, we have seen an increase in phishing attempts and spam emails over time and it is possible this trend will continue. also, in connection with geopolitical events and conflicts such as hamas-israel and russia-ukraine, we and our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches or incidents.  there can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our customers or third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. we have developed systems and processes to protect the integrity, confidentiality, availability and security of our systems, data and software, but our security measures or those of our customers or third-party service providers could fail and result in unauthorized access or damage to, or disablement, encryption, use, disclosure, modification, destruction or loss of, such systems, data and software. through contractual provisions and third-party risk management processes, we take steps to require that our third-party providers and their subcontractors protect our data, but we cannot ensure the security measures they take will be sufficient to protect our data. a vulnerability in a third-party provider’s or a customer’s software or systems, a failure of our customers’ or third-party providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures or a breach or incident of or impacting a customer’s or third-party provider’s software or systems could result in the compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our offerings or systems, or our or our customers’ data. further, security breach techniques are varied and continue to evolve, including through the use of ai to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks, and these attacks may not be detected until after an incident has occurred. we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures, anticipate, prevent or detect attempted security breaches or other security incidents or react in a timely manner.  we have contractual and other obligations to notify customers, regulators, impacted individuals or others of certain security incidents. we have made such notifications in the past and may be required to do so in the future. such disclosures or the failure to comply with relevant requirements could lead to adverse consequences. any security breach or incident that we or our third-party service providers experience, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in a loss of revenue or customer confidence in the security of our products and services, lead to negative publicity or otherwise harm our reputation and brand, reduce the demand for our products and services, disrupt normal business operations, divert management’s attention and resources, require us to spend material resources to investigate, correct existing or prevent future security breaches and incidents (including deploying additional personnel and modifying or enhancing our protection technologies and investigating and remediating any information security vulnerabilities), increase our insurance premiums or expose us to legal liabilities, including claims, litigation, regulatory enforcement and orders, disputes, investigations, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. we cannot ensure that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer, partner, vendor and other contracts would be enforceable or adequate with respect to any security lapse or breach or other security incident or protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. these risks will increase as we continue to grow and evolve our offerings to collect, host, store, transmit, and otherwise process increasing volumes of data.  further, if a security incident or breach occurs with respect to us or a competitor or third-party service provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of our products or services or database software generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles, may not be adequate for liabilities incurred or cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any security incident or breach or an insurer may deny or exclude from coverage certain types of claims. in the future, we may not be able to secure insurance for such matters on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. the successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition  of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we are not able to comply with, or are perceived to not comply with u.s. and foreign laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other requirements relating to data protection, information security and privacy, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. we are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, as well as industry standards, internal and external privacy policies and contractual obligations, relating to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information and other data. the regulatory framework governing these matters worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that these or other actual or asserted obligations may be interpreted and applied in manners inconsistent between jurisdictions and in conflict with other rules or our practices. any actual or perceived failure by us, our suppliers or other third parties with whom we do business to comply with laws, regulations, contractual obligations, or other actual or asserted obligations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. in many jurisdictions, including the united states, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. further, we have had and may in the future receive assertions of noncompliance by private actors. such assertions may result in fines, investigations or settlement costs. in addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. if we fail to follow these standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.  internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the united kingdom (“uk”), switzerland and the eu. the eu has adopted the general data protection regulation (“gdpr”), which went into effect in may 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the eu member states, contains numerous requirements relating to the processing of personal data of eu data subjects, including the increased jurisdictional reach of the european commission (“ec”) and more robust compliance obligations. among other requirements, the gdpr regulates transfers of personal data subject to the gdpr to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data. the gdpr also introduced numerous data processing and notification requirements and increased fines. in particular, under the gdpr, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the gdpr’s requirements. such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us with respect to transfers of personal data, the efficacy and longevity of transfer mechanisms upon which we rely remains uncertain. we have in the past and may in the future be required to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers impacted by legal or regulatory developments and be subject to increasing costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. more generally, we may find it necessary or desirable to modify our personal data handling practices, and the outcomes of legal challenges relating to cross-border personal data transfer may serve as a basis for our personal data handling practices, or those of our customers and vendors, to continue to be challenged, which may adversely affect our business. the uk has adopted a version of the gdpr (combining the gdpr and the data protection act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions. furthermore, there will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of data protection law between the uk and the european economic area. we continue to monitor and review the impact of any resulting changes to eu or uk law that could affect our operations. we may incur liabilities, expenses, costs and other operational losses under the gdpr and data protection laws of the applicable eu member states and the uk in connection with any measures we take to comply with them. other countries have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency or restricting the international transfer of personal data. in addition, domestic data privacy laws continue to evolve and could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and expose us to further regulatory or operational burdens. for example, the california consumer privacy act (“ccpa”) took effect in january 2020 and was subsequently modified by the california privacy rights act (“cpra”). the ccpa imposes obligations on companies that process california residents’ personal information, including an obligation to provide certain new disclosures to such residents and creates new consumer rights. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. this private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. the cpra also created a new state agency vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra. additionally, numerous other states have enacted privacy laws that have gone or will go into effect in the near future. while these new privacy laws may share similarities with each other, as well as with the cpra and ccpa, they differ in many ways and we must comply with each if our operations fall within their scopes. similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and certain states have enacted other privacy-focused legislation, such as washington’s enactment of the my health, my data act, which provides for a private right of action. all of these developments reflect a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states. we expect that this increase in legislation and regulatory scrutiny will continue to add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. additionally, in connection with couchbase capella, we may receive higher volumes of data, including sensitive and regulated data, which may require us to comply with additional legal or regulatory requirements. for example, we may store and process protected health information on behalf of our customers, which may subject us to a number of data protection, security and privacy requirements under our contracts and under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (“hipaa”) and other laws and regulations. we may sign business associate agreements with certain customers and be directly subject to provisions of hipaa applicable to business associates, as well as additional contractual requirements. we may also be subject to additional data protection, security and privacy requirements relating to cardholder data, including the payment card industry data security standard. increased customer adoption of couchbase capella may result in further increases in such requirements. if we are, or are perceived to be, unable to maintain the privacy and security of such sensitive and regulated data, we could be subject to claims and demands by private parties, investigations and other proceedings by regulatory authorities, and significant fines, civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. complying with these laws, regulations, contractual or other obligations relating to privacy, security, data protection, transfer or localization and information security may require us to modify our products and services, incur substantial operational costs, modify our data practices and policies and restrict our business operations. any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations or other actual or asserted obligations may lead to significant fines, penalties, regulatory investigations, lawsuits, significant costs for remediation, damage to our reputation or other liabilities. the interpretation and application of many privacy, security, and data protection laws, regulations and standards are uncertain, and it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory enforcement or orders, investigations and other proceedings, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities, any of which could require significant additional expense and have an adverse effect on our business, including impacting our ability to innovate, delaying our product development roadmap and adversely affecting our relationships with customers and our ability to compete. we may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all, and our ability to develop new product features and services could be limited.  in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our products and services. our customers expect us to meet certain voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or continue providing our services to certain customers and could harm our business. further, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment may cause concerns regarding privacy, data protection or security, and may cause our customers to resist providing data that could improve our products and services, or limit the use and adoption of our products and services.  these laws, regulations, rules, industry standards and contractual or other obligations relating to privacy, security, data protection, transfers or localization and information security could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and otherwise process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our products and services, to reach existing and potential customers or to derive insights from customer data. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these laws, regulations, standards and obligations, or any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection or security-related concerns, even if unfounded, may limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  any future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend. in addition to litigation regarding intellectual property, employment, governmental and regulatory investigations, and other claims discussed above, from time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, product liability, class action, whistleblower and other litigation, claims and proceedings. such proceedings can be time-consuming and difficult to estimate, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, require us to change our business practices or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses. in addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage for errors and omissions will be adequate or available or continue to be available on acceptable terms. indemnity provisions in various agreements to which we are party potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation and other losses. our agreements with our customers, partners and other third parties may include capped or uncapped indemnification provisions, which may survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement and under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred from claims of infringement, misappropriation or violation of intellectual property rights, data breaches, damages or other liabilities caused by us, or relating to or arising from our products and services, our acts or omissions under such agreements or other contractual obligations. large indemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. although we attempt to contractually limit indemnity obligations, we are not always successful and may still incur substantial liability related to such claims and we may be required to halt certain functions of our products or services. moreover, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenses in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources and harm our business and reputation. in addition, although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance against this liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim, and such coverage may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any dispute with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with customers, channel parties or other third parties or other existing or potential customers, harm our reputation or reduce demand for our products and services.  a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to heavily regulated organizations, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. we provide our products and services to heavily regulated organizations, and at times to federal, state and local governments and non-u.s. governments directly and through our partners. selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance of sales. for instance, highly regulated entities and government customers often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements, impose complex compliance requirements, require preferential pricing or “most favored nation” terms and conditions or are otherwise time-consuming and expensive to satisfy. if we undertake to meet special standards or requirements and do not meet them, we could be subject to increased liability. even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our services to such customers could harm our financial condition and results of operations. we have been and are increasingly doing more business in heavily regulated industries. customers in these industries may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our products and services. in addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward third-party vendors generally, or to us in particular, that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet. any changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect these types of customers could harm our ability to efficiently provide our products and services to them and to grow or maintain our customer base. moreover, customers in these heavily regulated areas often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products and practices. if one or more of such customers determine that some aspect of our business does not meet contractual or regulatory requirements, we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business. each of these difficulties could adversely affect our business and results of operations. failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. we are subject to the fcpa, the u.s. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 u.s.c. § 201 and the u.s. travel act and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside of the united states where we conduct our activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively recently and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, partners and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. we may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities through third parties that sell our products and services and conduct our business abroad or through our employees, agents, representatives, partners and third-party intermediaries. we may be held liable for their corrupt or other illegal activities even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. these laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. while we have policies and procedures designed to address compliance with such laws, we cannot ensure that none of our employees, agents, representatives, partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. any allegations or violation of the fcpa or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions or suspension or debarment from federal contracts. responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. in addition, the u.s. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. as a general matter, any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to governmental export control, trade sanctions and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls. certain of our business activities are subject to the u.s. export control laws and regulations, including the export administration regulations (the “ear”) and the u.s. trade and economic sanctions maintained by the u.s. department of treasury’s ofac as well as the u.s. import laws and regulations. the u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export, re-export and in-country transfer of our offerings, including software and services, to certain u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries and territories, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. further, we incorporate encryption functionality into certain of our products. as a result, we submit reports about certain of our products to the u.s. department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security to ensure that our exports, re-exports and transfers are in accordance with the ear. also, in certain cases, it is possible that a license may be required to export or re-export our products to certain countries and end-users. obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering may be time-consuming or unfeasible and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. if we do not comply with such u.s. export controls, economic sanctions and import laws and regulations or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations and the possible loss of our export or import privileges. we take precautions designed to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control, sanctions and import laws and regulations, but we cannot ensure that our measures will always succeed since such laws and regulations are very detailed and technical. in addition, changes in our products or services or changes in export and import regulations in various countries may create delays in the introduction of our products and services into international markets, prevent the deployment of our products and services globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products and services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or in their scope or targets, could result in decreased use of our products and services by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and services to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our international operations may subject us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets and consider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions, the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions, including the united states, our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany agreements. the relevant taxing authorities may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. changes in tax laws could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. for example, the inflation reduction act of 2022 imposes a 15% minimum tax for large corporations on global adjusted financial statement income for tax years beginning after december 31, 2022, and a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases occurring after december 31, 2022. we do not currently expect that the ira will have a material impact on our income tax liability, but will continue to monitor this change in future periods. we are unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the u.s. and other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business. any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. there is also a high level of uncertainty in today’s tax environment stemming from both global initiatives put forth by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (the “oecd”) and unilateral measures being implemented by various countries such as pillar two and the global minimum tax. if these proposals are passed, it is likely that we will have to pay higher income taxes in countries where such rules are applicable. as we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the u.s. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. our ability to use our net operating losses may be limited. as of january 31, 2024, we had federal and state net operating losses (“nols”) of $335.6 million and $193.2 million, respectively, which may be available to offset taxable income in the future. a lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these nols before they expire. unused u.s. federal nols for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused nols expire. under the tax cuts and jobs act, u.s. federal nols arising in tax years beginning after december 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such u.s. federal nols is limited to 80% of current year taxable income. of our u.s. federal nols, $166.9 million may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income. the remaining $168.7 million will begin to expire in 2028. our state nols carryforwards begin to expire in 2026. under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change nols to offset its post-change income may be limited. in general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. similar rules may apply under state tax laws. subsequent ownership changes and changes to the u.s. tax rules in respect of the utilization of nols may further affect the limitation in future years. there is also a risk that due to u.s. federal or state regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of nols, our existing nols could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. adverse outcomes in tax audits or changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to review and audit by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. as a result, we may receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions. taxing authorities have made inquiries of us and may in the future investigate or challenge our tax positions and methodologies on various matters, including our positions regarding the collection of sales and use taxes and the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxes, which could expose us to additional taxes. we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from any ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. these assessments can require considerable judgments and estimates. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a variety of jurisdictions. there can be no assurance that our tax positions and methodologies or calculation of our tax liabilities are accurate or that the outcomes from tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we collect sales tax in a number of jurisdictions. sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. such tax assessments, penalties, interest or future requirements would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (“gaap”) are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board, the sec and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. changes in accounting principles applicable to us, or varying interpretations of current accounting principles, in particular with respect to revenue recognition, could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of the change. further, any difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the recognition and measurement of certain assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses that is not readily apparent from other sources. our accounting policies that involve judgment include standalone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation, capitalized internal-use software costs, expected period of benefit for deferred commissions, valuation of our common stock prior to our ipo, valuation of stock-based awards, determination of allowance for doubtful accounts, incremental borrowing rate used to measure operating lease liabilities, and accounting for income taxes. if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our results of operations could be adversely affected or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (the “sarbanes-oxley act”), and the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market. our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. moreover, these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and revisions. such changes could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher legal and financial costs. we continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, which may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention. if our compliance efforts differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to refine and improve our disclosure controls, internal controls and other procedures to ensure disclosures required in sec filings are timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that disclosures under the exchange act are accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from any international expansion. further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. any failure or difficulties to develop, maintain, implement or improve effective controls could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the sec. any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock. in addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the nasdaq global select market. our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” at such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating."
BASE,"risks related to ownership of our common stock and governance matters operating as a public company has and will require us to incur substantial costs and will require substantial management attention. as a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. compliance with the rules and regulations of the exchange act, the applicable requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, the rules and regulations of the sec and the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market have increased and may further increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” in addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in unanticipated ways. as a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. these = obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
BASE,"we are an “emerging growth company” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the jobs act, and we intend to take advantage of certain available exemptions, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. in addition, we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period under the jobs act to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause failure to meet our financial reporting obligations, regulatory discipline or harm investor confidence. we may take advantage of these exemptions for so long as we are an “emerging growth company,” which could be for as long as five full fiscal years following the completion of our ipo. if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market and a more volatile market price for our common stock. our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock continue to have substantial control over us, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. our executive officers, directors and our stockholders who own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our common stock. as a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring stockholders’ approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. the market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock and include the following:  price and volume fluctuations and investor confidence in the overall stock market and in technology stocks or those in our industry in particular;  sales or short selling of our common stock or related derivative securities;  failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  any changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections;  announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features and market acceptance of such new offerings or platform features;  the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec;  rumors and market speculation in our industry, whether or not involving us;  actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations or key business metrics;  actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;  announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, offerings or technologies by us or our competitors;  developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;  litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors, or securities class action litigation against us;  new laws, regulations, rules or industry standards or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, rules or industry standards applicable to our business;  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;  any significant change in our management; and  general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets and other geopolitical developments. stock markets in general, and the markets for technology stocks in particular, have previously experienced and may in the future experience extreme volatility, including as a result of global economic conditions. furthermore, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by third parties, such as short sellers, trying to drive down the price of our common stock. these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. if our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline and our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities could be impaired. many of our existing equity holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold, and may take, or attempt to take, steps to sell, directly or indirectly, their shares or otherwise secure the value of their unrecognized gains on those shares. in addition, certain of our stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register their shares for public sale in the united states. sales of our common stock pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at an appropriate time. these sales also could cause the market price of our common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell our common stock. the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity compensation plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders. subject to applicable rules and regulations and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we may issue additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity compensation plans or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. our status as a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, regardless of the potential benefit to our existing stockholders. in addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:  our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms, and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;  certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require the approval of at least 2/3 of our then-outstanding common stock;  our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide for cumulative voting;  vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;  a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors;  certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware;  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and  advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders. these provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests, election of stockholders’ director nominees and other corporate actions our stockholders may desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium as part of a sale of our company and could also affect the price of our common stock in a change of control. our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. section 22 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, (the “securities act”), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such securities act actions. accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the united states will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaints asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act. we note, however, that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this exclusive forum provision. if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations. if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our common stock could decline. the trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. if any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. if few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the market price and trading volume of our common stock to decline. we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, if any, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment in our common stock."

NOW,"investing in our securities involves risks. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, before making an investment decision. the occurrence of any of the following risks, or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause our stock price to decline. the following risks have been grouped by categories and are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence."
NOW,"risk factors summary this summary provides an overview of the risks we face and should not be considered a substitute for the more fulsome risk factors discussed immediately following this summary.   risks related to our ability to grow our business  laws, regulations and customer expectations regarding the use, storage and movement of data may restrict our ability to continue to optimize our platform and adversely affect our business."
NOW," we participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.  if we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.  if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.  we rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed.  doing business with the public sector and heavily-regulated entities subjects us to risks related to government procurement processes, regulations and contracting requirements.  if we fail to comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, export control laws, economic and trade sanctions laws, or other global trade laws, we could be subject to penalties and civil and/or criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected.  targeting larger enterprise customers may result in longer and more expensive sales cycles, increased pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges.  as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional shareholder dilution."
NOW," risks related to the operation of our business  actual or perceived cybersecurity events experienced by us or our third-party service providers may create the perception that our platform is not secure, and we may lose customers or incur significant liabilities, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.  if we lose key members of our management team or qualified employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need, our costs may increase and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.  delays in the release of, or actual or perceived defects in, our products may slow the adoption of our latest technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide services, decrease customer satisfaction, and adversely impact future product sales."
NOW," disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses, subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results.  delays in improving our information systems and processes could interfere with our ability to support our existing and growing customer and employee base and could adversely impact our business.  lawsuits by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results.  our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results.  our use of open-source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation.  various factors, including our customers’ business, integration, migration, compliance and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations of our products to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful.  our failure or perceived failure to achieve our esg goals or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations could adversely affect us.  natural disasters, including climate change, and other events beyond our control could harm our business."

NOW," risks related to ownership of our common stock  our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.  provisions in our governing documents, delaware law or 2030 notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and, therefore, depress our stock price. risks related to our ability to grow our business laws, regulations and customer expectations regarding the use, storage and movement of data may restrict our ability to continue to optimize our platform and adversely affect our business. governments have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, laws and regulations affecting the use, storage and movement of data, including laws related to data privacy and security, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (“ai”), and data sovereignty or residency requirements. changing laws, regulations and standards applying to the collection, storage, use, sharing, portability, transfer or other control or processing of data, including personal data, could affect our ability to efficiently and cost-effectively offer our services and to develop our products and services for maximum utility, as well as our customers’ ability to use data or share data. such changes may restrict our ability to use, store or otherwise process customer data in connection with providing services and could alter or increase our compliance requirements. in some cases, this could impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers’ ability to deploy our services globally. for example, the eu data act is a proposed law with potential significant requirements regarding data portability, interoperability and accessibility and unclear data transfer restrictions, any of which could impact our operations. in addition, although the new trans-atlantic data privacy framework (which replaced the prior privacy shield) has been approved, which could facilitate the transfer of data between the united states (“u.s.”) and european union (“eu”), there remains a possibility that this framework could be challenged in court.  as we continue to innovate and improve the offerings on our platform by leveraging machine learning and ai, our business model may be affected by global trends and laws that regulate the use of ai and machine learning. such laws or regulations not only may cause us to modify our data handling practices, which could be costly or burdensome, it also may impact our ability to use certain data for developing our products or impede customers regulated by such laws and regulations to adopt our products. in addition, we may become subject to new or heightened legal, ethical or other challenges arising out of the perceived or actual impact of ai on human rights, intellectual property, privacy, and employment, among other issues, and we may experience brand or reputational harm, legal liability or increased costs associated with those issues. we offer region-specific services, by which customer data is hosted locally and customers may elect to receive support from locally based servicenow teams. setting up and maintaining these region-specific services require significant investment, including to comply with applicable laws and regulations. actual or perceived non-compliance with those laws and regulations could result in proceedings or investigations against us by regulatory authorities or others, lead to significant fines, damages, orders, litigation or reputational harm and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.  we will also need to continually adapt to customer privacy and security requirements as they change over time. for example, as customers increasingly adopt a hybrid (on-premises and off-premises/hyperscale cloud) approach for their it workloads, our cloud services may fail to address evolving customer requirements, including data localization. further, due to heightened concerns relating to privacy and security regulatory matters, our customers may request certain certifications and failure to obtain, or consistently maintain, those certifications may adversely impact our reputation and business."
NOW,"we participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. as the market for digital workflow products and offerings matures and new technologies, in-house solutions and competitors enter the market, we increasingly compete with alternative solutions and approaches to solve customer needs or experience customer reluctance or unwillingness to migrate away from their current solutions. further, we expect additional competition as we shift our products and services to compete with providers in adjacent markets.  some of our existing competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition, the ability to more efficiently scale their business, more established operations and customer relationships, and greater financial and technical resources than we do. competitors, regardless of their size, may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements and buying practices. they may introduce new technology, solve similar problems in different ways or more effectively utilize existing technology that reduces demand for our services. they may utilize acquisitions, integrations or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products, enhanced functionality or other advantages. “systems of record” operators may attempt to create technology solutions or other mechanisms that would prevent our systems from integrating with theirs. they may create pricing pressures by reducing the price of competing products, services or subscriptions or bundling their offerings causing our offerings to appear relatively more expensive. in addition, competition from cloud-based vendors may increase as they partner with on-premises hardware providers to deliver their cloud platform as an on-premises or data localized solution. if we are not able to compete successfully, we could experience reduced sales and margins, losses or failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. if we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed. we compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly. the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers recognize the advantages of acquiring leading digital technologies and adopting modern cloud-based infrastructure. as digital transformation accelerates across a customer’s enterprise, cutting-edge capabilities such as ai, machine learning, hyper automation, low-code/no-code application development, system observability and predictive insights become increasingly relevant to the customer’s evolving needs. accordingly, to compete effectively, we must:   identify and innovate in the right technologies;  keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments, such as ai, which may disrupt talent needs and the enterprise software marketplace;  accurately predict our customers’ changing digital transformation needs, priorities and adoption practices, including their technology infrastructures and buying and budgetary practices;   invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that we continue to meet the very high-performance expectations of our customers;   successfully deliver new, scalable technologies and products to meet customer needs and priorities;   efficiently integrate with technologies within our customers’ digital environments;   expand our offerings into industries and to buyers who are not familiar with our offerings;  profitably and efficiently market and sell products in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience;   successfully adapt new pricing models;   effectively secure our platform, data and customers’ data; and   effectively deliver, directly or through our partner ecosystem, the digital transformation process planning, it systems architecture planning, and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful.  further, in response to evolving customer needs, we may make significant investments in changing how we offer our products or services, such as bundling offerings or shifting to a subscription-based model for support services or how our services are delivered or priced. if customers are dissatisfied with these changes, our business could be materially adversely impacted. if we are unsuccessful in increasing our penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. sales outside of north america represented 36% and 35% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the growth of our business and future prospects depend on our ability to increase our sales outside of the u.s. as a percentage of our total revenues. additionally, operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to varying regulatory, political and economic risks. we  have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in data centers, geographic-specific service delivery models, advisory councils, cloud computing infrastructure, sales, marketing, partnership arrangements, personnel and facilities in new geographic markets. when we make these investments, it is typically unclear when we will see a return on our investment, and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful. our rate of acquisition of new large enterprise customers, a factor affecting our growth, has been generally lower in territories where we are less established and where there may be heightened or evolving regulations and operational and ip risks. we have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in new geographic markets, including hiring qualified sales management personnel, penetrating the target market, and managing local operations. risks associated with making our products and services available in international markets include, for example:  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;  requirements to have local partner(s), local entity ownership limitations or technology transfer or sharing requirements, or to comply with data residency and transfer laws and regulations, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, which may increase operational costs and restrictions;  the possibility that illegal or unethical activities of our local employees or business partners will be attributed to us or cause us harm;  longer and potentially more complex sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;  different pricing and distribution environments;  potential changes in international trade policies, tariffs, agreements and practices, including the adoption and expansion of formal or informal trade restrictions or regulatory frameworks that may favor local competitors;  governmental direction, business practices and/or cultural norms that may favor local competitors;   more prevalent cybersecurity and intellectual property risks; and  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses.  if we are unable to manage these risks, our revenue growth rate, business and operating results will be adversely affected. we rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed. an increasing portion of our revenues is generated by sales through our network of partners, including managed service providers and resellers. increasingly, we and our customers rely on our partners to provide professional services, including custom implementations, and there may be insufficient qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand. while we provide our partners with training and programs, including accreditations and certifications, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently by partners. in addition, new partners may require extensive training and/or significant time and resources to become productive. changes to our direct go-to-market models may cause friction with our partners. the actions of our partners may subject us to potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our partners misrepresent to our customers the functionality of our platform or products, fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations, or violate laws or our corporate policies. in addition, our partners may use our platform to develop products and services that compete with our products and services, which could raise ip ownership concerns and strain these partnerships. if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners, our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed. doing business with the public sector and heavily-regulated entities subjects us to risks related to government procurement processes, regulations and contracting requirements. we provide products and services to governmental and heavily-regulated entities directly and through our partners. we have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support our efforts to sell to those entities. processes to obtain authorizations and certifications required for us to provide our products and services to those entities often are lengthy and encounter delays, and we may not be able to satisfy, or maintain compliance with, the associated requirements. a substantial majority of our sales to government entities in the u.s. have been made indirectly through our distributors, resellers or service provider partners. doing business with government entities presents a variety of risks. the procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive and time-consuming, may be subject to political influence and may involve different rules and conditions on the offering or pricing of products and services. we incur significant up-front time and expense without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor, reseller or service provider) will win a contract. beyond this, demand for our products and services may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown, partisan gridlock or changes to government policy. further, if we or our partners are successful in receiving a contract award, that award could be challenged during a bid protest process.  bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. even if a bid protest were unsuccessful, the delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.  our customers also include non-u.s. governments, to which government procurement risks similar to those present in u.s. government contracting and regulatory compliance also apply, particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established. we have seen challenges to successful awards through bid protest procedures in jurisdictions outside the u.s. as our non-u.s. government business grows, we may see an increase in bid protests as part of the standard government procurement legal procedures that exist in many jurisdictions. in addition, compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources. in certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. each of these difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default, though such risk may be assumed by such third-party distributor or reseller. if a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses. if a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with governmental entities. further, we are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. these may also include rights with respect to price protection, refund and setoff, performance of services in languages other than english, the accuracy of information provided to the government, contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies, constraints on sales practices and other obligations that are particular to government contracts. these obligations may apply to us and/or our third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. such parties’ non-compliance could create contractual and customer satisfaction issues.  in addition, governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements. if it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, all of which may cause us to suffer reputational harm and adversely affect our business and operating results. further, we are increasingly doing business in heavily regulated industries, such as financial services, telecommunication, media and television, and health care. current and prospective customers in those industries may be required to comply with more stringent regulations to subscribe to and/or implement our services. in addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements on third-party vendors that we may not meet. further, customers in these heavily-regulated industries often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products and practices. if one or more customers determine that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements, our ability to continue or expand our business with those customers may be restricted. if we fail to comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, export control laws, economic and trade sanctions laws, or other global trade laws, we could be subject to penalties and civil and/or criminal sanctions and our business could be materially adversely affected. as we continue to expand our business internationally, we will inevitably do more business with large private enterprises and the public sector in countries outside of the u.s. increased business in countries with heightened levels of corruption subjects us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and potential liability from our business operations. we have an established compliance program, but there is a risk that our employees, partners, customers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could violate our policies and applicable law, exposing us to additional scrutiny and potential liability. we have experienced this in the past and may experience it again in the future. in addition, we are subject to global trade laws that apply to our worldwide operations, including prohibitions or restrictions on conducting business in certain geographies or involving certain counterparties or end-users. as a result of the russia-ukraine conflict, for example, the u.s. and other countries have imposed economic and trade sanctions and export control restrictions against russia and belarus. if this conflict continues or if conflict arises in other jurisdictions, the u.s. and other jurisdictions could impose wider economic and trade sanctions as well as export restrictions, which could impact our business opportunities and operations. any violation of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, the uk bribery act, other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, or applicable export control or economic and trade sanctions laws by our employees or third-party intermediaries could  subject us to significant risks such as adverse media coverage and/or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. targeting larger enterprise customers may result in longer and more expensive sales cycles, increased pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges.  as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face heightened costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in our ability to close sales. larger enterprise customers tend to require considerable time evaluating and testing our platform prior to making a purchasing decision, require multiple levels of review and approval, and demand more configuration, integration services and features, particularly when switching from legacy on-premises solutions. as a result, these sales opportunities may require us to devote significant sales support and professional services to a smaller number of larger transactions, diverting those resources from other sales opportunities. if we fail to effectively manage these risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected.  as we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional shareholder dilution or costs. we have acquired and invested in companies and technologies as part of our business strategy and will continue to evaluate and enter into potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of or investments in businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, to expand or improve our service offerings and functionality, go-to-market and sales efforts, our operations or our ability to source necessary expertise and provide services in international locations. although we conduct reasonably extensive due diligence regarding these businesses and assets, our efforts may not reveal every material issue. strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including:  difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies;   failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment;  potential loss of employees of the acquired company;  inability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and partners of the acquired business;  potential adverse tax consequences;  disruption to our business and diversion of management attention and other resources;  potential financial, credit or regulatory risks associated with acquired customers, suppliers and partners of the acquired business;  dependence on acquired technologies or licenses for which alternatives may not be available to us or which may involve significant cost or complexity;   in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures, languages, and legal regimes and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;   introducing increased complexity and burden to maintain the technology platform;   introducing vulnerabilities or threats by integrating acquired technologies or businesses;  data security or privacy risks, compliance requirements, or integration costs from the acquired technology or company;  impairment of our investments or the possibility our investees will be unable to obtain future funding on favorable terms or at all; and   potential unknown liabilities or disputes associated with the acquired businesses. in addition, the amount or form of consideration we pay for acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition or stock price. for example, if we finance an acquisition by issuing equity or convertible debt securities or loans, our existing shareholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of those securities or indebtedness. the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, operating results and financial condition."
NOW,"risks related to the operation of our business actual or perceived cybersecurity events experienced by us or our third-party service providers may create the perception that our platform is not secure, and we may lose customers or incur significant liabilities, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results. in the ordinary course of our business, we store, transmit, generate, and process our and our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive data. as our business expands across the globe, the number of employees, contractors, vendors and other third parties remotely accessing our systems continues to grow. our growing business operations increase our exposure to cyberattacks by a range of actors, who have used and will continue to use assorted tactics, techniques, and  procedures, including malicious code, ransomware, social engineering, business email compromises, supply chain attacks, denial of service attacks and similar internet-enabled, fraudulent activity. further, during times of war and other major conflicts, we and our third-party providers may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of geopolitically motivated attacks, including cyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain and ability to provide our services.  the cybersecurity threats are not limited to actors operating in the systems we control directly. our increasing reliance on third-party providers and public cloud infrastructure introduces new cybersecurity risks to our business operations. we rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate business systems in a variety of contexts, and supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity. while we have a vendor security review process, we cannot guarantee that our third-party service providers or our supply chain infrastructure have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our platform, systems and network or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our business. our ability to monitor the data security measures of our third-party providers is limited, and we necessarily depend in part on our providers to have in place and maintain adequate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks and the mishandling of data. further, employee error or malfeasance in configuring, maintaining and using these services could impact our ability to monitor and secure them effectively.  while we have identified vulnerabilities in our products and services in the past and will continue to do so in the future, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify all vulnerabilities or address the vulnerabilities of which we become aware. further, there have been delays and may continue to be delays in developing patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. third parties have, in the past, actively searched for and exploited actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software and will do so in the future. moreover, the incorporation of third-party or open-source software code into our or our customers’ systems increases the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities, such as the vulnerability in the java logging library known as “log4j” that affected our industry. we also have inherited and may in the future inherit additional security risks from acquiring or partnering with other companies. in most instances, our customers are responsible for administering access to the data held in their particular instance for their employees and service providers. while our software is delivered with certain preset configurations, we understand that our customers require flexibility to configure the now platform to their specific business needs. we work closely with our customers to help them evaluate their security configurations, including providing guidance to align configuration settings with their business needs. yet, in configuring our platform, both our employees and customers have made errors in the past and may do so again in the future. we are aware that, on occasion, our customers and servicenow have configured certain settings on our platform, or retained preset configurations, in a manner not aligned with their preferred security levels, which can result in, and has resulted in, information being made more widely accessible than intended. such misconfigurations can be, and have been, identified publicly, increasing the risk of data being exposed unintentionally.  while we have security measures and a data governance framework in place designed to protect our and our customers’ information and prevent data loss, these measures may not be effective at preventing material breaches caused by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by employees, contractors or third parties. techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to systems are constantly evolving and may go undetected until a successful attack occurs. moreover, we have experienced security incidents, which may reoccur in the future, that resulted in unauthorized access to, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential, proprietary and sensitive information. we have observed attempts by third parties to induce or deceive our employees, contractors or users to fraudulently obtain access to our or our customers’ data or assets. further, our employees have fallen victim to phishing attacks in the past and may again in the future. an actual or perceived security breach can have a material effect on servicenow’s operations, finances and reputation. the adverse consequences can include accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to data; disruptions to our services; diversion of funds; litigation; indemnification and other contractual obligations; regulatory investigations; government fines and penalties; reputational damage; negative publicity; loss of sales, customers, and partners; mitigation and remediation expenses; and other material costs and liabilities. in addition, the assessment and response to security incidents, as well as implementation of appropriate safeguards to protect against future incidents, can lead to material economic and operational consequences. these consequences can result regardless of whether the incident is suffered by us, affects our third-party service providers or stems from customers action or inaction. moreover, even if a breach is unrelated to our security programs or practices, it could still cause us reputational harm and require us to undertake significant efforts to assess and respond to the breach, including further protecting our customers from their own vulnerabilities. there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. in addition, while we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot be certain that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or"
NOW,"in sufficient amounts to cover potential losses from a security incident or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.  if we lose key members of our management team or qualified employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need, our costs may increase and our business and operating results may be adversely affected. there is increasingly intense competition for talent in the technology industry. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our management team, particularly our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and the other members of our executive staff. from time to time in the ordinary course of business, there have been and may continue to be changes in our management team. while we seek to manage these transitions carefully, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and negatively affect our business. in the highly competitive technology industry, we face ongoing challenges in attracting and retaining top talent across various roles, such as product development and engineering (particularly with ai and machine learning backgrounds), sales, operations and cybersecurity. these key individual contributors are critical to our success and can command very significant compensation in the market. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth may depend on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient qualified personnel to support our growth. we have faced and may continue to face difficulties attracting, hiring and retaining highly-skilled, qualified personnel and may not be able to fill positions in desired geographic areas or at all. further, as we continue to grow and expand our workforce globally, we may face operational and workplace culture challenges that could negatively impact our ability to maintain the effectiveness of our business execution and the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. while our work model, where a substantial portion of our employees work partially or fully remote, increased our access to talent, we may not be able to take advantage of a broader talent pool if our competitors offer the same work model or if we continue to lean heavily on our primary operating locations for talent. we are continually evaluating and, as appropriate, enhancing the attractiveness of our compensation packages. as a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher sales, potentially resulting in a reduction in our profitability. in addition, we grant equity awards to our employees and sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors reduces the retention value of such awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. many of our employees, including all of our executive officers, are employed “at-will” and may terminate their employment with us at any time. if we fail to attract qualified, new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected. delays in the release of, or actual or perceived defects in, our products may slow the adoption of our latest technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide services, decrease customer satisfaction, and adversely impact future product sales. we must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products. the success of any release depends on a number of factors, including our ability to manage the risks associated with actual or perceived quality or other defects or deficiencies, delays in the timing of releases or the adoption of releases by customers, and other complications that may arise during the early stages of introducing our products. if releases are delayed or if customers perceive that our releases contain bugs or other defects or are difficult to implement, customer adoption of our new products or updates may be adversely impacted, customer satisfaction may decrease, our ability to efficiently provide our services may be reduced, and our growth prospects may be harmed. disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers’ businesses, subject us to substantial liability and harm our reputation and financial results. our business depends on our platform to be available without disruption. from time to time, we experience defects, disruptions, outages and other performance and quality problems with our platform. new defects may be detected in the future and may arise from our increasing use of the public cloud. for example, we provide regular updates to our services, which can contain undetected defects. defects may also be introduced by our use of third-party software, including open-source software. disruptions may result from errors we make in developing, delivering, configuring or hosting our services, or designing, installing, expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure. disruptions in service can also result from incidents that are outside of our control, including denial of service or ransomware attacks. we currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data centers operated by several different providers located around the world, and we serve certain of our customers that are primarily in highly regulated markets, using data center facilities operated by public cloud service providers. these data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, energy grid constraints resulting in power loss and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, equipment failure and adverse events caused by operator error or negligence. in addition, an increased use of the public cloud increases our vulnerability to cyberattacks. despite precautions taken at these centers, problems at these centers have occurred, resulting  in interruptions in our services. such problems could occur again and result in similar or lengthier service interruptions and the loss of customer data. in addition, our customers may use our services in ways that cause disruptions in service for other customers. in addition to data center providers, we also have a large ecosystem of vendors and service providers that we use for our products. if there is a compromise to data, supply chain issue or other incident with our critical service providers, it may impact our ability to provide our services and reduce our productivity. our customers use our services to manage important aspects of their businesses, and our reputation and business will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. disruptions or defects in our services may reduce our revenues, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions, and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. similarly, customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency and performance depending on their business models and customers in highly regulated markets may have more demanding requirements that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet. the occurrence of payment delays, service credit, warranty or termination for material breach or other claims against us could result in an increase in our bad debt expense, an increase in collection cycles, an increase to our service level credit accruals, other increased expenses or risks of litigation. we may not have insurance sufficient to compensate us for potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from disruptions to our services. delays in improving our information systems and processes could interfere with our ability to support our existing and growing customer and employee base and could adversely impact our business. we rely on our information systems and those of third parties to operate and scale our business. we have made and continue to make investments to improve our information system infrastructure to support the needs of our growing customer and employee base, increase productivity, develop and enhance our services, expand into new geographic areas, and scale with our overall growth. such improvements are often complex, costly, and time consuming. if implementation of such improvements are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted as we may experience disruptions in our business operations, loss of customers, loss of revenue, or damage to our reputation, all of which could harm our business plan to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity. lawsuits by third parties that allege we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results. there is considerable patent and other ip development activity and claims and related litigation regarding patent and ip rights in our industry. our competitors, other third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use and have used to assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of ip rights against us. moreover, the patent portfolios of many of our competitors and other third parties are larger than ours. this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors or other third parties may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. we have recorded material charges for legal settlements of such claims in the past. in any ip litigation, regardless of the scope or merit, we may incur substantial costs and attorney’s fees and, if the claims are successfully asserted against us and we are found to be infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating the ip rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or make substantial ongoing royalty payments; comply with an injunction and cease offering or modify our products and services; comply with other unfavorable terms, including settlement terms; and indemnify our customers and business partners, obtain costly licenses on their behalf, and/or refund fees or other payments previously paid to us. further, upon expiration of the term of any agreements that allow us to use third-party ip, we may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms, if at all, in which case we may face ip litigation. in addition, our subscription agreements generally require us to defend our customers against claims that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties. the mere existence of any lawsuit, or any interim or final outcomes, and the public statements related to it (or absence of such statements) by the press, analysts and litigants could be unsettling to our customers and prospective customers. this could adversely impact our customer satisfaction and related renewal rates, cause us to lose potential sales, and could also be unsettling to investors or prospective investors and cause a substantial decline in our stock price. any claim or litigation against us could be costly, time-consuming and divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results. our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results. our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other ip protections in the u.s. and other jurisdictions. the ip protection we have for our technology may not provide sufficient protection, and any ip acquired in the future may not provide  competitive advantages or other value. in addition, our ip may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon them. further, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of ip rights vary.  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use, or may have copied or obtained and used, our technology to develop products and services that provide features and functionality similar to ours. policing unauthorized use of our ip and technology is difficult. our competitors could also independently develop services equivalent to ours, and our ip rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from utilizing their developments to compete with us. reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it, which would significantly harm our business.  our ip rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative proceedings or litigation. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer services. the laws of some foreign countries may not offer effective protection for, or be as protective of, ip rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of ip rights or available remedies may be inadequate, ineffective or scarce. additionally, the ip ownership and license rights of new technologies such as ai have not been fully addressed by u.s. courts interpreting current and new laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of such technologies in our products and services may expose us to potential intellectual property claims; breach of a data license, software license, or website terms of service allegations; claimed violations of privacy rights; and other tort claims. if such laws or regulations require increased transparency, it may impair protection of our trade secrets or other ip. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights. we have initiated and, in the future, may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and may result in counterclaims with respect to infringement or misappropriation of ip rights by us. if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our ip rights or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our ip rights, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.  our use of open-source software could harm our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to possible litigation. our products incorporate software licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses, and we expect to continue to incorporate open-source software into our products and services in the future. we monitor our use of open-source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products and services to adverse licensing conditions. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful. there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of the terms of open-source licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is uncertain and enforcement of these terms may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services. for example, depending on which open-source license governs certain open-source software included within our products and services, we may be subjected to conditions requiring us to offer our products and services to users at no cost; make available the source code for modifications and derivative works based upon, incorporating or using such open-source software; and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open-source license. moreover, if an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations, be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from distributing our products and services.  various factors, including our customers’ business, integration, migration, compliance and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations of our products to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers either through us or our partners. further, our customers’ business, integration, migration, compliance and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, or other factors may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. as a result of these and other risks, we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase, implementation and enablement of our products. some customer implementations may take longer than planned, delay our ability to sell additional products or fail to meet our customers’ expectations, resulting in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented. some customers may lack the internal resources to manage a digital transformation such as our offering and, as a consequence, may be unable to see the benefits of our products. unsuccessful, lengthy, or costly implementations and integrations could  result in claims from customers, reputational harm, and opportunities for competitors to displace our products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.  our failure or perceived failure to achieve our esg goals or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations could adversely affect us. we have published environmental, social, and governance (“esg”) initiatives, goals and commitments. our ability to achieve our objectives is subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control. our failure or perceived failure to achieve some or all of our esg goals or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations or regulatory requirements could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, regulatory authorities and others or subject us to liability. our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our customers, employees and other stakeholders have about our action or inaction on esg issues. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results or stock price. natural disasters, including climate change, and other events beyond our control could harm our business. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may damage or disrupt our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a negative effect on our business. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, extreme heat, power shortages, pandemics such as covid-19, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyberattacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change and other events beyond our control. while we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such planning may not account for all possible events and the occurrence of such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, and could cause us to incur substantial expense. our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expenses we may sustain. although we have backup systems in place, in the event of major natural disasters or catastrophic events, customer data could be lost, and resumption of operations could require significant time. we may be subject to increased costs, regulations, reporting requirements, standards or expectations regarding climate change-driven impacts on our business. while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs as part of our esg strategy and partnering with organizations that are focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, certain of those risks are inherent wherever business is conducted. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our california headquarters have experienced, and may continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency and severity, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfires. changing market dynamics, global policy developments and increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the u.s. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our customers and third-party suppliers and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations."
NOW,"risks related to the financial performance or financial position of our business because we generally recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term, a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions. net new annual contract value from new subscriptions and expansion contracts entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenues for the duration of the subscription term. as a result, a significant portion of the revenues we report in each period are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous periods. consequently, a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions, expansion contracts in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenues for that period, but they will negatively affect our operating results in future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers are generally recognized over the applicable subscription term. also, our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited."
NOW,"as our business grows, we expect our revenue growth rate to decline over the long term. you should not rely on our prior revenue growth as an indication of our future revenue growth. while we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods, we expect it to decline over the long term due to increasing competition, a decrease in the growth rate of our overall market or other reasons. we also expect our costs to increase in  future periods as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, which may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business.  changes in our effective tax rate or disallowance of our tax positions may adversely affect our financial position and results. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effects of acquisitions. increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses. additionally, our future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings. the u.s. department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will comply with the law, which could affect our results of operations in the period issued. many countries are actively considering or have proposed or enacted changes to their tax laws based on the model rules adopted by the organization for economic cooperation and development defining a 15% global minimum tax (commonly referred to as pillar 2) that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses and increased scrutiny under tax examinations could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our financial results. any changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. in addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by tax jurisdictions throughout the world, many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of cloud computing companies. although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period. further, many of our most important intangible assets are held outside the u.s. and are subject to inter-company agreements regarding the development and distribution of those assets to other jurisdictions with potential challenge under permanent establishment or transfer pricing principles. while we believe that our position is appropriate and well founded, if our position were successfully challenged by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions, we may become subject to significant tax liabilities, which could harm our financial position and financial results. our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition. our ability to make payments on, repay or refinance the 2030 notes in the future will depend on our future performance which is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. if we decide to refinance the 2030 notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the 2030 notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. maintenance of our indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and additional issuances of indebtedness could:  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;  increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;  impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and  due to limitations within the debt instruments, restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole, materially change our business or incur subsidiary indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions. we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in the indentures governing the 2030 notes. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. downgrades in our credit ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing."
NOW,"risks related to general economic conditions global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations. we operate globally and as a result, our business, revenues and profitability are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions. the success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions, including, among others, inflation, interest rates, tax rates, foreign exchange rates, economic downturns, recession, economic uncertainty, political instability, warfare, changes in laws, trade barriers, supply chain disruptions and economic and trade sanctions. the u.s. capital markets experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. furthermore, inflation rates in the u.s. and other key markets have recently increased to levels not seen in decades resulting in federal action to increase interest rates, affecting capital markets. such economic volatility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and future market disruptions could negatively impact us. these unfavorable economic conditions could increase our operating costs and, because our typical contracts with customers lock in our price for a few years, our profitability could be negatively affected. geopolitical destabilization and warfare have impacted and may continue to impact global currency exchange rates, commodity prices, energy markets, trade and movement of resources, which may adversely affect the buying power of our customers, our access to and cost of resources from our suppliers, and ability to operate or grow our business. in addition, from time to time, the u.s. and other key international economies have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by geopolitical and economic instability, high levels of credit defaults, international trade disputes, changes in demand for various goods and services, high levels of persistent unemployment, wage and income stagnation, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies, international trade agreements, export controls, economic and trade sanctions, health crisis such as the covid-19 pandemic and overall economic uncertainty. these conditions can arise suddenly and affect the rate of digital transformation spending and could adversely affect our customers’ or prospective customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our services, delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results."
NOW,"foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could harm our financial results. we conduct significant transactions, including revenue transactions and intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the u.s. dollar or the functional operating currency of the transactional entities. in addition, our international subsidiaries maintain significant net assets that are denominated in the functional operating currencies of these entities. accordingly, changes in the value of currencies relative to the u.s. dollar have impacted and may continue to impact our consolidated revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings. it is particularly difficult to forecast any impact from exchange rate movements, unanticipated currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ from investor expectations or our own guidance in any future periods. volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to political and economic uncertainty globally. we use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forwards, to hedge exposures that certain of our balance sheet items have to changes in foreign currency rates. these hedging contracts have reduced and may continue to reduce, but they have not and cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. further, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions as we may not be able to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the exposures being hedged."
NOW,"risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. in addition, technology companies in general have highly volatile stock prices, and the volatility in stock price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. factors affecting our stock price, some of which are beyond our control, include, among other factors:"
NOW," changes in the estimates of our operating results, revenue growth, or changes in recommendations by securities analysts;   changes in the average contract term of our customer agreements, timing of renewals and renewal rates;   our ability to meet our financial guidance or financial performance expectations of the securities analysts or investors;  announcements of new products, services or technologies, new applications or enhancements to services, strategic alliances, acquisitions, or other significant events by us or by our competitors;  fluctuations in company valuations, such as high-growth or cloud companies, perceived to be comparable to us;   changes to our management team;  trading activity by directors, executive officers and significant shareholders, or the market’s perception that large shareholders intend to sell their shares;  the inclusion, exclusion, or removal of our stock from any major trading indices;  the size of our market float;  the trading volume of our common stock, including sales following the exercise of outstanding options or vesting of equity awards;  changes in laws or regulations impacting the delivery of our services;  significant litigation or regulatory actions;  the amount and timing of customer payments, payment defaults, operating costs and capital expenditures  the amount and timing of equity awards and the related financial statement expenses;   the impact of new accounting pronouncements;   the inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;  our ability to accurately estimate the total addressable market for our products and services; and  overall performance of the equity markets. following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business. this could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. provisions in our governing documents, delaware law or 2030 notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and, therefore, depress our stock price. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress our stock price by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or changes in our management that our shareholders may deem advantageous. these provisions, among other things:  permit our board to establish the number of directors;  provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of 66 2/3% of our shareholders;  require super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;  authorize issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a shareholder rights plan;  prohibit shareholder action by written consent, which requires all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting;  permit our board to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and  require advance notice for shareholders to submit director nominations or other business at annual shareholders meetings (although our bylaws permit shareholders proxy access). further, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and certain shareholders. in addition, the terms of our 2030 notes may cause a delay or prevent a change in control of our company, as they allow noteholders to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a change in control repurchase event."
S,"item 1a. risk factors investing in our class a common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included before making a decision to invest in our class a common stock. our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our class a common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. summary risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those risks more fully described below. these risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks: risks related to our business and industry  we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment.   we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected."
S," we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.  adverse global macroeconomic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability, and regulatory exposure, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.  if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely affect our customer relationships and overall business.  we may not be able to timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements.   if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed."
S,"risks related to regulatory matters  if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share, or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.  risks related to our people  we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. risks related to our intellectual property  our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us.  third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights, and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock   the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.   the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our ipo, including our directors, executive officers, and other beneficial owners who hold in the aggregate approximately 72% of the voting power of our capital stock, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. risks related to our business and industry  we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment.  we were founded in january 2013 and released our first endpoint security solution in february 2015. our limited operating history and financial data may make it difficult to evaluate our current business, future prospects and other trends. we have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries and sectors, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable or established market. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to fluctuations in our markets or otherwise, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business and operating results would be adversely affected. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future. the risks associated with having a limited operating history may be exacerbated by current global macroeconomic conditions.  we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. we have incurred net losses in all periods since our inception, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we experienced a net loss of $338.7 million and $378.7 million for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. as of january 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. while we have historically experienced significant growth in revenue, we cannot predict when or whether we will reach or maintain profitability. we also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to drive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers in new geographic locations, which will negatively affect our operating results if our total revenue does not increase. in addition to the anticipated costs to grow our business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a public company, particularly now that we are no longer an emerging growth company. our revenue growth is expected to slow as we grow and our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our platform, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities, including acquisitions, new products, services, and feature releases. while we consistently evaluate opportunities to reduce our operating costs and optimize efficiencies, including, for example, our restructuring plan in june 2023, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that we will not re-accelerate operating expenditures in the future in order to capitalize on growth opportunities. if we fail to increase our revenue to offset increases in our operating expenses or manage our costs as we invest in our business, we may not achieve or sustain profitability."
S,"we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  the market for cybersecurity products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and is rapidly evolving, characterized by changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and frequent introductions of new or improved products and services. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market, as our competitors complete strategic acquisitions or form cooperative relationships and/or customer requirements evolve. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we would experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. for a description of our competitors, see the section titled “business—competition.” our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:  our ability to attract and retain new customers, expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers;  our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate talented employees;   our ability to successfully incorporate new technologies into our platform, including ai;   the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of our customers, including any slowdown in technology spending due to us and general global macroeconomic conditions;  general global macroeconomic and political conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including global economic slowdowns, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and potential global recession;  the impact of natural or man-made global events on our business, including wars and other armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and the tensions between china and taiwan;   changes in customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs;  price competition;  the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or customers and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors;  changes in our mix of products, subscriptions and services sold, including changes in the average contract length for subscriptions and support;  our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally;  changes in the growth rate of endpoint security, cloud security, and overall cybersecurity product platform and services sectors;   deferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new or enhanced products and services announced by us or our competitors;  significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to the use of our platform;  the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies, businesses, or strategic partnerships;  our ability to execute, complete, or efficiently integrate any acquisitions that we may undertake;  increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate;  our ability to increase the size and productivity of our distribution channels;  decisions by potential customers to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors;  timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;  insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, which could increase due to us and global macroeconomic issues, including actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, inflation, interest rate volatility, and market downturns, which would adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our platform, products, and services in a timely manner or at all;  the cost and potential outcomes of litigation or other proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;  future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and  increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do or bundle certain competing products and services at lower prices. our competitors may also have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, customer support and to pursue acquisitions, or they may have other financial, technical, or other resource advantages. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings and more mature distribution  and go-to-market strategies, which allows them to leverage their existing customer and distributor relationships to gain business in a manner that discourages potential customers from purchasing our platform.  conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, including but not limited to increased advancements and proliferation in the use of open artificial intelligence applications, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made or could make acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive products and services than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margin, increased net losses, and loss of market share. even if there is significant demand for endpoint and cloud security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we will have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other cybersecurity providers is different and more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of purchasing products and services from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive action with respect to pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.  our operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past, and we expect that our operating results will continue to vary significantly in the future such that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. this could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. fluctuations in quarterly results may negatively impact the trading price of our class a common stock. our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including, without limitation:  general global macroeconomic and political conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including global economic slowdowns, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and potential global recession;  the impact of natural or man-made global events on our business, including wars and other armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan;   our ability to attract new and retain existing customers or sell additional features to existing customers;  the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers;  the timing and length of our sales cycles;  changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs;  changes in the growth rate of the cybersecurity market generally and market for endpoint security;  the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us, including pinnacleone, our strategic risk analysis and advisory group, and singularity data lake, our live enterprise data platform for data queries, analytics, insights, and retention, or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors;  the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our platform;  our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;  decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  any disruption in our relationship with isvs, channel partners, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms;  insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solution;  significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the use of our platform or other cybersecurity incidents;  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes, taxes, regulatory fines or penalties;  future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices;  negative media coverage or publicity;  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; and  increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in our fourth fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers.  any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for the reasons described above or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action lawsuits. adverse global macroeconomic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. in addition, the purchase of our platform is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. weak global and regional economic conditions, including us and global macro-economic issues, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, spending environments, geopolitical instability, warfare and uncertainty, weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macro-economic conditions, including the effects of the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine, and tensions between china and taiwan and judicial reform in israel, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including resulting in longer sales cycles, a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers or expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers, lower prices for our platform, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced sales to new or existing customers and slower or declining growth. for example, as a result of current uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions and related higher cost consciousness around it budgets, we have recently experienced certain impacts on our business, including a decline in usage and consumption patterns from certain customers, especially larger enterprise customers, longer sales cycles, and deal downsizing by new customers and of renewals by existing  customers, especially larger enterprises. we expect the global macroeconomic conditions impacting demand to persist in the near term. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.  moreover, the us capital markets have experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. inflation rates in the us significantly increased in 2021 and 2022, resulting in federal action to increase interest rates, adversely affecting capital markets activity. further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and regulatory action may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  we are investing in expanding our platform, including our cloud security products, and it is difficult to predict adoption and demand. we are meaningfully investing in our platform, including growing our cloud security product. for example, in november 2023, through the acquisition of ksg, we launched pinnacleone, a strategic advisory group also operating as a think tank for hire, focused on helping companies and their executives holistically understand the evolving risks of operating in the modern global business landscape through personalized access to experts’ intelligence, insight, and transformative risk management strategies. further, in february 2024, we acquired pingsafe, a cloud security platform, which we expect will enable us to couple pingsafe’s cnapp with our cloud workload security and cloud data security capabilities.  it is difficult to predict customer adoption and demand for our platform, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products and services or the success of existing competitive products and services. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with, and customer adoption of, our platform. if the market for our platform does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our software or our services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, implementation challenges for deployment, technological challenges, competing technologies and services, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders and decreased revenue, which would adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. our platform interoperates with, but does not necessarily replace, other security and log analytics products. businesses that use other cybersecurity products and services may be hesitant to purchase our platform if they believe their existing products and services provide a level of security that is sufficient to meet their needs. if we do not succeed in convincing customers that our platform should be an integral part of their overall approach to security, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  if businesses do not continue to adopt our platform for any of the reasons discussed above or for other reasons not contemplated, our sales would not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. we may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.   we have recently begun incorporating generative ai into our offerings, including our purple ai solution dedicated to threat-hunting, analysis and response. as with many innovations, generative ai presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could impact our successful ability to incorporate the use of generative ai in our business. for example, language models may provide flawed results or misinterpret prompts. further, data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of ai solutions. this is turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analyses or other content that our ai-initiatives produce. in addition, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate generative ai solutions into their products more successfully than us, and their solutions may achieve higher market acceptance than ours, which may result in us failing to recoup our investments in developing generative ai-powered offerings. we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our ai technology, including in our purple ai solution. our ability to employ ai, or the ability of our competitors to do so more successfully, may negatively impact our gross margins, impair our ability to compete effectively, result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our operating results.   moreover, ai may give rise to litigation risk, including potential intellectual property, privacy, or cybersecurity liability. because ai is an emerging technology, there is not a mature body of case law construing the appropriateness of certain of its uses of data - whether through the employment of large language models or other models leveraging data found on the internet - and the evolution of this law may limit our ability to exploit artificial intelligence tools, or expose us to litigation. further, ai presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of ai algorithms draws controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.  in addition, given the complex nature of ai technology, we face an evolving regulatory landscape. for example, in october 2023, president biden issued an executive order that establishes new standards for, among other things, ai safety, security, and privacy. moreover, we are subject to significant competition from other companies, some of which have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources than us. our competitors may incorporate ai into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our financial results. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.  a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability and regulatory exposure, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.  companies are subject to an increasing number and wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, ransomware, account takeover, business email compromise, employee fraud, theft or misuse, denial of service attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks that create risks for our internal networks and cloud deployed products and the information they store and process. cybersecurity companies face particularly intense attack efforts, and we have faced, and will continue to face, cyber threats and attacks from a variety of sources. the research that we conduct and report may make us, or our customers, a further target for attacks of all kinds. state-supported and geopolitical-related cyberattacks may rise in connection with regional geopolitical conflicts such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan. in addition, our cybersecurity product is likely considered a valuable target for lateral attacks because of its highly privileged access. moreover, the ongoing war in ukraine and associated activities in ukraine and russia have increased the risk of cyberattacks on various types of infrastructure and operations, and the us government has warned companies to be prepared for a significant increase in russian cyberattacks in response to the sanctions on russia. there may also be increased risks of cybersecurity attacks as a result of the unfolding events in the middle east. additionally, bad actors are beginning to utilize ai-based tools to execute attacks, creating unprecedented cybersecurity challenges.  although we have implemented security measures to prevent such attacks, our networks and systems may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, human or employee error, insufficient cybersecurity controls, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our and/or our customers’ systems, networks, or data. we may face difficulties or delays in identifying or otherwise responding to any attacks or actual or potential security breaches or threats. these risks are exacerbated by developments in generative ai. a breach in our data security or an attack against our platform could impact our networks or the networks and data of our customers that are secured by our platform, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and providing access to malicious parties to information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers, resulting in data being publicly disclosed, misused, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and adversely affect our financial condition. if compromised, our own systems could be used to facilitate or magnify an attack. further, the increase in remote work by companies and individuals in recent years has generally increased the attack surface available to bad actors for exploitation, and as such, the risk of a cybersecurity incident potentially occurring has increased. we have accordingly increased our investments in protective measures and risk mitigation strategies, but we cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents. protecting our own assets has become more expensive from a dollar investment and time perspective and these costs may increase as the threat landscape increases, including as a result of use by bad actors of ai. any actual, alleged, or perceived security breach in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, costly litigation, and other liability. we would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations, and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information. for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (ccpa), as amended by the california privacy rights act (cpra), imposes a private right of action for security breaches that could lead to some form of remedy including regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. where a security incident involves a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alternation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data from the european economic area (eea) or the uk in respect of which we are a controller or processor under the general data protection regulation (gdpr), and the uk general data protection regulation and uk data protection act 2018 (uk gdpr), this could result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater, under the gdpr or up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater, in the case of the uk gdpr. we may also be required to provide notice of such breaches to regulators and/or individuals which may result in us incurring additional costs, penalties, fines or litigation. further, on july 26, 2023, the sec adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management (including the board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports on form 10-k. these cybersecurity disclosure rules also require the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents by form 8-k, within four business days of determining an incident is material. any public disclosure relating to a material cybersecurity incident, whether as a result of the new sec rules or otherwise, harm our reputation, result in litigation and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.  in addition, certain of our customer agreements may require us to promptly report security breaches involving their data on our systems or those of subcontractors processing such data on our behalf. this mandatory disclosure could be costly, result in litigation, harm our reputation, erode customer trust, and require significant resources to mitigate issues stemming from actual or perceived security breaches. in addition, we may incur significant financial and operational costs to investigate, remediate, eliminate and put in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. any of these negative outcomes could adversely affect the market perception of our platform and customer and investor confidence in our company, and would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform and product features are multi-faceted and may be deployed with material defects, software “bugs” or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment to our customers. from time to time, certain of our customers have reported defects in our platform related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. our platform and product features also provide our customers with the ability to customize a multitude of settings, and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure our platform or otherwise fail to configure our products in an optimal manner. such defects and misconfigurations of our platform could cause our platform to operate at suboptimal efficacy, cause it to fail to secure customers’ computing environments and detect and block threats, or temporarily interrupt our customers’ computing environments. we also make frequent updates to our platform, which may fail, resulting in temporary vulnerability that increases the likelihood of a material defect. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage target computing environments change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our platform is unable to detect or prevent. furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, our networks, platform, products, including cloud-based technology, and customers could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business, harm our reputation or use our technology to gain unauthorized access. in addition, regional geopolitical conflicts such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, may result in increased cyberattacks against our customers, resulting in an increased risk of a security breach of our customers’ systems. in addition, defects or errors in our platform could result in a failure to effectively update customers’ cloud-based products. our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers’ computing environments, leaving their computing environments unprotected against cyber threats. any of these situations could result in negative publicity to us, damage our reputation, and increase expenses and customer relations issues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.  advances in computer capabilities, discoveries of new weaknesses and other developments with software generally used by the internet community may increase the risk we will suffer a security breach. furthermore, our platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, ransomware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our platform to reflect industry trends, new technologies and new operating environments, the complexity of the environment of our clients and the sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. our platform may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons. we or our service providers may also suffer security breaches or unauthorized access to personal information, financial account information, and other confidential information due to employee error, rogue employee activity, unauthorized access by third parties acting with malicious intent or who commit an inadvertent mistake or social engineering. if we experience, or our service providers experience, any breaches of security measures or sabotage or otherwise suffer unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, personal information, financial account information or other confidential information, we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to address these problems. we may not be able to remedy any problems caused by hackers or other similar actors in a timely manner, or at all. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our platform does not provide significant value, our reputation and business would be harmed. any real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our platform, or any other failure of our platform to detect an advanced threat, could result in:  a loss of existing or potential customers;  delayed or lost revenue and adverse impacts to our business, operating results, and financial condition;  a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;  the expenditure of significant financial and research and development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, and address and eliminate vulnerabilities;  an increase in resources devoted to customer service and support, which could adversely affect our gross margin;  harm to our reputation or brand; and  claims and litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, enforcement actions, and other claims and liabilities, all of which may be costly and burdensome and further harm our reputation. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are launched against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. moreover, if a high-profile cybersecurity incident occurs with respect to another saas provider, customers may lose trust in the security of the saas business model generally, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. in the last few years there have been many successful advanced cybersecurity incidents that have damaged several prominent companies despite strong information security measures. we expect that the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents and the costs of preventing such attacks will continue to increase in the future. in addition, we cannot assure you that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers, or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter or as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the us, or other countries. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our reputation. we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services, products, technologies, or talent. for example, in february 2021 we acquired scalyr, a data analytics company, in may 2022 we acquired attivo, a leading identity security and lateral movement protection company, in november 2023 we acquired ksg, a strategic advisory group, and in february 2024 we acquired both pingsafe, a cloud security platform, and stride, a security automation company. we have also invested in certain privately held companies through our s ventures fund, and we may not realize a return on these investments. all of our venture investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner is not guaranteed.  in the future, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. our due diligence efforts may fail to identify all of the challenges, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings involved in an acquisition. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we announce or complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or investors.  in addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating existing and future acquisitions, or the technologies and personnel associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. additionally, integrations could take longer than expected, or if we move too quickly in trying to integrate an acquisition, strategic investment, partnership, or other alliance, we may fail to achieve the desired efficiencies.  we have, and may in the future have, to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders, which depending on the size of the acquisition, may be significant. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.  additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include:  diversion of management’s time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;  the inability to coordinate research and development and sales and marketing functions;  the inability to integrate product and service offerings;  retention of key employees from the acquired company;  changes in relationships with strategic partners or the loss of any key customers or partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;  cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;  integration of the acquired company’s accounting, customer relationship management, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;  the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies;  unexpected security risks or higher than expected costs to improve the security posture of the acquired company;  higher than expected costs to bring the acquired company’s it infrastructure up to our standards;  additional legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements;  financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we don’t adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect;  liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;   failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment; and  litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from or against terminated employees, customers, current and former stockholders, or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. historically, we have experienced rapid growth in the adoption of our platform, customer base, and revenue. however, we may not return to our prior growth rates or grow at the same rate in the future. any success that we may experience in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things:  maintain, renew and expand our existing customer base;  continue to attract new customers;  induce customers to expand deployment of the initially adopted module(s) of our platform across their organizations and infrastructure, and to adopt additional modules of our platform and services;  improve the capabilities of our platform through research and development;  continue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; and  successfully compete with other companies in the endpoint security industry. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one to three years, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths or cease using certain features. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solution, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition, general economic conditions, or the perceived decline in the incidence of cyberattacks. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, operating results, and financial condition will materially suffer.  if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform must effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing it infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products and services from multiple vendors, and contains multiple generations of products and services that have been added over time. as a result, our solutions can sometimes encounter interoperability issues on deployment or over time, which require additional support and problem solving with customers, in some cases, at a substantial cost to us. we may modify our software or introduce new capabilities so that our platform interoperates with a customer’s infrastructure. these issues could cause longer deployment and integration times for our platform, leading to customer churn, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. in addition, government and other customers may require our platform to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. if we are unable to achieve, or are delayed in achieving, compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our platform to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely impact our customer relationships and overall business. our platform is hosted by third-party cloud hosting providers including aws. our software and systems are designed to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by such cloud hosting providers, and currently our cloud service infrastructure is primarily run on aws. we have experienced, and expect in the future that we may experience from time to time, interruptions, delays or outages in service availability due to a variety of factors. capacity constraints could arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks. the level of service provided by our cloud hosting providers, or regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also impact the use of, and our customers’ satisfaction with, our platform and could harm our business and reputation. in addition, hosting costs are expected to increase as our customer base grows, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, aws has discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us, including on contract renewal, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. aws, and other cloud hosting providers, may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, competing with us, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process data on their system in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. although we obtain services from other cloud hosting providers, if our current arrangement with aws were to be terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our content available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for expansion and transition to alternative cloud hosting and infrastructure services. such a transition could require further technical changes to our platform, including, but not limited to, our cloud service infrastructure which was initially designed to run on aws. making such changes could be costly in terms of time and financial resources. any of these factors could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause our customers to decline to renew their subscriptions, any of which would harm our business and operating results.  we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements.  our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grows. as our customers gain more experience with our platform, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, and the number of locations where our platform is being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications, and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. in some circumstances, we may also determine to scale our technology through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development, which may divert management’s time and resources. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solution, we will not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we will be unable to compete as effectively and our business and operating results will be adversely affected.  if we do not accurately anticipate and promptly respond to changes in our customers’ technologies, business plans or security needs, our competitive position and prospects will be adversely impacted. the cybersecurity market has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. moreover, many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require  them to add numerous network-connected endpoints and adapt to increasingly complex it environments, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. as their technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. we face significant challenges in ensuring that our platform effectively identifies and responds to these advanced and evolving attacks, including as a result of the evolving ai landscape. as a result of the continued rapid innovations in the technology industry, including the rapid growth of smartphones, tablets and other devices, enterprise employees using personal devices for work, the rapidly evolving internet of things and ai, we expect the networks of our customers to continue to change rapidly and become more complex. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, enhancements to our platform that adequately address the changing needs of our customers. in addition, any enhancements to our platform could involve research and development processes that are more complex, expensive and time-consuming than we anticipate. we may experience unanticipated delays in the availability of enhancements to our platform and may fail to meet customer expectations with respect to the timing of such availability. if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing and releasing updates to our platform on a timely basis that can adequately respond to advanced threats and our customers’ evolving needs, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.  we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and our reputation as a leading provider of endpoint and platform security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to develop additional features for our platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions, our marketing efforts, and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue.  under certain circumstances, our employees may have access to our customers’ platforms. an employee may take advantage of such access to conduct malicious activities. any such misuse of our platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and operating results. in addition, independent industry and research firms often evaluate our solutions and provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or research firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed.  moreover, the performance of our channel partners and alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed.  substantially all of our sales are fulfilled through our channel partners, including resellers, distributors, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms, and we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from channel partners for the foreseeable future. our agreements with our channel partners are non-exclusive, do not last for set terms, and may be terminated by either party at any time. further, channel partners fulfill our sales on a purchase order basis and do not impose minimum purchase requirements or related terms on sales. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  to the extent our partners are unsuccessful in selling our platform, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high-quality partners in each of the regions in which we sell or plan to sell our platform, we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our platform, or our partners shift focus to other vendors and/or our competitors, our ability to sell our platform and operating results will be harmed. the termination of our relationship with any significant partner may adversely affect our sales and operating results. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our ability to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform.  we are also exposed to credit and liquidity risks and our operating results will be harmed if our partners were to become unable or unwilling to pay us at all or in a timely manner, terminate their relationships with us or go out of business. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate such risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our risks. if we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. if partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these partners, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. our partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners. in such instances, we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity, and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited. we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners, as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible, which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could adversely affect our business and operating results.  our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable and subject to budgetary uncertainty. we have made significant investments to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. although we anticipate that they may increase in the future, sales to governmental organizations have not accounted for, and may never account for, a significant portion of our revenue. sales to governmental organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely affect our business and operating results, including the following risks:  selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;  government certification, software supply chain or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our platform may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the governmental sector until we have attained the revised certification or meet other new requirements. for example, although we are  currently fedramp authorized, such authorization is costly to maintain and subject to rigorous compliance and if we lose our authorization, it will restrict our ability to sell to government customers;  government demand and payment for our platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our platform, including as a result of sudden, unforeseen and disruptive events such as government shutdowns, governmental defaults on indebtedness, war, regional geopolitical conflicts around the world, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics;  governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and operating results, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if an investigation, audit, or other review, were to uncover improper or illegal activities;   governments may require certain products to be manufactured, produced, hosted or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost locations, and we may not produce or host all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies; and  refusal to grant certain certifications or clearance by one government agency, or decision by one government agency that our products do not meet certain standards, may cause reputational harm and cause concern with other government agencies.  the occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governmental organizations to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results. our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sale of our platform to customers located outside of the us and our current, and any further, expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are generating a growing portion of our revenue outside of the us, and conduct our business activities in various foreign countries, including some emerging markets where we have limited experience, where the challenges of conducting our business can be significantly different from those we have faced in more developed markets and where business practices may create internal control risks including:  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could add volatility to our operating results;  new, or changes in, regulatory requirements;  tariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures;  exposure to numerous, increasing, stringent (particularly in the eu), and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security;  costs of localizing products and services (including, but not limited to data localization requirements);  lack of acceptance of localized products and services;  the need to make significant investments in people, solutions and infrastructure, typically well in advance of revenue generation;  challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs;  difficulties in maintaining our corporate culture with a dispersed and distant workforce;  treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and other potential tax issues, including with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements;  different or weaker protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property;  economic weakness or currency-related crises;  compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, data privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur and regulations applicable to us and our third party data providers from whom we purchase and resell syndicated data;  vetting and monitoring our third-party channel partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;  generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures;  the lack of reference customers and other marketing assets in regional markets that are new or developing for us, as well as other adaptations in our market generation efforts that we may be slow to identify and implement;  dependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics, including the armed conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan;  actual or perceived instability in the global banking system;   cybersecurity incidents;   corporate espionage; and  political instability and security risks in the countries where we are doing business and changes in the public perception of governments in the countries where we operate or plan to operate. we have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, additional corporate operating restructurings from time to time that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad. we consider various factors in evaluating these restructurings, including the alignment of our corporate legal entity structure with our organizational structure and its objectives, the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure, and the long-term cash flows and cash needs of our business. such restructurings increase our operating costs, and if ineffectual, could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate. we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage our future growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.  we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and we expect to continue to invest broadly across our organization to support our growth. for example, our headcount grew from over 2,100 employees as of january 31, 2023, to over 2,300 employees as of january 31, 2024. although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not sustain our growth rates, nor can we assure you that our investments to support our growth will be successful. the growth and expansion of our business will require us to invest significant financial and operational resources and the continuous dedication of our management team.  in addition, as we have grown, our number of customers has also increased significantly, and we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our platform in more complex computing environments. the rapid growth and expansion of our business places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, in june 2023, we approved a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce and operations with current business needs, priorities, and near-term growth expectations.  if we continue to experience rapid growth, we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. for example, as we grow, we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. as we grow, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. any future growth will continue to add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, cause difficulty or delays in deploying new customers, reduce demand for our platform, cause difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.  our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our platform, particularly with respect to large organizations and government entities. for example, in light of current macroeconomic conditions, we have observed a lengthening of the sales cycle for some prospective customers that we attribute to higher cost-consciousness around it budgets, which has become more pronounced recently. customers often view the subscription to our platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens our sales cycle.  our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the sales prices of our platform may decrease, or the mix of our sales may change, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform. as the market for endpoint security matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that are similar to or compete with ours, we may be unable to effectively optimize our prices through increases or decreases, attract new customers at our offered prices or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. further, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services. this could lead customers to demand greater price concessions or additional functionality at the same price levels. as a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or provide more features without corresponding increases in price, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our operating results.  we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the term of their subscription, which is generally one to three years. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decrease in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide partial refunds or our customers could be entitled to terminate their contracts and our business would suffer.  certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability of our platform and our support services. failure of or disruption to our infrastructure or third-party hosting service providers could impact the performance of our platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with credit, partial refunds or termination rights. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheets for such commitments. our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.  we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our platform will harm our business and operating results. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the us or other countries. the sale and support of our platform also entails the risk of product liability claims. we employ measures in the form of policy and technical controls to limit unauthorized access to our platform by our employees, customers and third parties, however, these measures may not fully or effectively protect our platform from unauthorized access. additionally, we typically provide indemnification to customers, partners or other third parties we do business with for certain losses suffered or expenses incurred as a result of third-party claims arising from our infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. we also provide unlimited liability for certain breaches of confidentiality, as defined in our master subscription agreement. we also provide limited liability in the event of certain breaches of our master subscription agreement. certain of these contractual provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. however, as we continue to grow, indemnification claims against us for the obligations listed may increase. when our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require  significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our platform, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or in certain limited circumstances, other claims, would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  additionally, our platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended.  we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover the claims asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we have offered some of our customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have remediated warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering warranties which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, although the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control (ofac), list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise subject to us sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions, in violation of our warranty and applicable law. key business metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and to change as our business evolves, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected by real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics or any changes in metrics we disclose. we regularly review key business metrics, including our arr, number of customers with arr of $100,000, nrr, and other measures to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. these key metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement at the time of reporting, there are inherent challenges in such measurements. if we fail to maintain effective processes and systems, our key metrics calculations may be inaccurate, and we may not be able to identify those inaccuracies. we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we make adjustments to improve their accuracy. moreover, we may periodically change the definition or methodology underlying our key metrics. for example, as a result of a decline in usage and consumption in the quarter ended april 30, 2023, we decided to change our methodology of calculating arr for consumption and usage-based agreements to reflect committed contract values as opposed to based on consumption and usage. in addition, as part of our quarterly review of arr in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended april 30, 2023, we discovered some historical inaccuracies relating to arr on certain contracts, which we have corrected. as a result, we made a one-time adjustment of approximately 5% of total arr, which we reflected in our total arr as of april 30, 2023. if our key metrics are inaccurate or if investors perceive any changes to our key business metrics or the methodologies for calculating these metrics negatively, our business could be adversely affected. risks related to our people we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. the loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team or members of our board of directors, as well as certain of our key marketing, sales, finance, support, product development, people team, or technology personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of tomer weingarten, our co-founder, chairman of the board of directors, president, and chief  executive officer, who is critical to the development of our technology, platform, future vision, and strategic direction. from time to time, there have been and may in the future be changes in our management team. while we seek to manage any such transitions carefully, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge, cause disruptions to our business and negatively affect our business. further, we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in israel which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our workforce and we have implemented continuity measures to address the safety of our employees and continue our operations in the event of reduced employee availability in the conflict region. however, if our continuity measures fail or the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations. competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, especially in the san francisco bay area, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. more generally, the technology industry, and the cybersecurity industry more specifically, is also subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and related services. moreover, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. we have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. we may be required to provide more training to our personnel than we currently anticipate. further, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, overall macroeconomics and workforce participation rates. should our competitors recruit our employees, our level of expertise and ability to execute our business plan would be negatively impacted. in june 2023, we approved a restructuring plan, which impacted approximately 5% of our workforce. this reduction may adversely impact our ability to achieve our future operational targets. in the future, we may be unable to hire qualified employees and may be unable to successfully train those employees that we are able to hire, and as a result, employees may not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected or at all. further, the reduction could yield unanticipated consequences or disruptions in our day-to-day operations, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions.  additionally, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may also negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. changes in us immigration and work authorization laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. our business may be adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes.  moreover, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team, sales team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions.  in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards and other compensation they receive in connection with their employment. if the perceived value of our compensatory package declines, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. further, our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. in recent years, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates.  although we have entered into employment agreements with our key employees, these agreements are on an “at-will” basis, meaning they are able to terminate their employment with us at any time. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. if we do not effectively integrate, train, manage, and retain sales personnel, and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may be unable to increase our customer base and increase sales to our existing customers.  our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to expand our sales and marketing operations. we have and plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs and to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to target additional potential customers, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting and maintaining additional customers. if we are unable to find efficient ways to deploy our sales and marketing investments or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our business and operating results would be adversely affected.  furthermore, we plan to continue expanding our sales force and there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our success in hiring, integrating, training, managing, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth, particularly in international markets. new hires require significant training and may take extended time before they are productive. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, or at all, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. moreover, our international expansion may be slow or unsuccessful if we are unable to retain qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets which we target.  if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, manage, and retain a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. any inability to maintain a high-quality customer support organization could lead to a lack of customer satisfaction, which could hurt our customer relationships and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. once our platform is deployed within our customers’ computing environments, our customers rely on our technical support services to assist with service customization and optimization and to resolve certain issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our platform and advanced services. if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our platform, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services as part of our platform to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our product and business reputation and on positive recommendations, referrals, and peer promotions from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial condition. we believe that our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.  we believe that our corporate culture has been, and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. if we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, inclusion, creativity, and teamwork that we believe is important to support our growth. as we implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of  our corporate culture, which could negatively impact our future success. we are also taking steps to develop a more inclusive and diverse workforce, however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so."
S,"risks related to our intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us. we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, and confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our technology. valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or platform. any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. patent applications in the us are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. in addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the us may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications. such changes may lead to uncertainties or increased costs and risks surrounding the prosecution, validity, ownership, enforcement, and defense of our issued patents and patent applications and other intellectual property, the outcome of third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property brought against us and the actual or enhanced damages (including treble damages) that may be awarded in connection with any such current or future claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. however, such agreements may not be enforceable in full or in part in all jurisdictions and any breach could negatively affect our business and our remedy for such breach may be limited. the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. lastly, the measures we employ to limit the access and distribution of our proprietary information may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property. as such, we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. policing unauthorized use of our technology or platform is difficult. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the us. for example, many foreign countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. effective trade secret protection may also not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have employees or independent contractors. the loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality. in addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and employment laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. from time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. moreover, the availability of copyright protection and other legal protections for intellectual property generated by certain technologies, such as generative ai, is uncertain. the use of generative ai and other forms of ai may expose us to risks because the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other ai output, has not been fully interpreted by us courts or been fully addressed by us federal or state regulation, as well as in foreign jurisdictions.  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and platform protected other than by patent rights), we will find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create our platform and other innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. third parties have claimed and may claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our current or future products and services infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may result in legal claims against our channel partners, our alliance partners, our customers and us. these claims may damage our brand and reputation, harm our customer relationships, and create liability for us. contractually, we are expected to indemnify our partners and customers for these types of claims. we expect the number of such claims to increase as the number of products and services and the level of competition in our market grows, as the functionality of our platform overlaps with that of other products and services, and as the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase. we generally agree in our customer and partner contracts to indemnify customers for certain expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third-party intellectual property infringement claims associated with our platform. to the extent that any claim arises as a result of third-party technology we have licensed for use in our platform, we may be unable to recover from the appropriate third party any expenses or other liabilities that we incur. companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. furthermore, patent holding companies, non-practicing entities, and other adverse patent owners that are not deterred by our existing intellectual property protections may seek to assert patent claims against us. from time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have invited us to license their patents and may, in the future, assert patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, our alliance partners, or our customers. we have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.  there may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and assets. we may also face exposure to third-party intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation actions if we engage software engineers or other personnel who were previously engaged by competitors or other third parties and those personnel inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of third parties into our products. in addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market, and support potential products or enhancements, which could severely harm our business. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate, and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. these claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, and may require us to indemnify our customers for liabilities they incur as a result of such claims. these claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. we might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. alternatively, we could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort, and expense, and may affect the performance or features of our platform. if we cannot license or develop alternative non-infringing substitutes for any infringing technology used in any aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our"
S,"platform and may be unable to compete effectively. any of these results would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.  we currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. licensing technologies from third parties exposes us to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement and vulnerabilities due to, among other things, our lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the care taken to safeguard against risks. we cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our platform. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business, including our financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner, or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. third-party software we rely on may be updated infrequently, unsupported or subject to vulnerabilities that may not be resolved in a timely manner, any of which may expose our solutions to vulnerabilities. as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.  some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation.  our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code, which they are not typically required to maintain and update, and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. although we monitor our use of open source software in an effort both to comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses and to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities.  some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available as source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon our use and distribution of the open source software. if we combine and distribute our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release combined the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solution, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our platform, and reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us.  the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source  code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims, regardless of validity, could result in time consuming and costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention away from developing the business, expose us to customer indemnity claims, or force us to disclose source code. litigation could be costly for us to defend, result in paying damages, entering into unfavorable licenses, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or cause delays by requiring us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solution."
S,"risks related to legal and regulatory matters we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.  we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in our markets. our platform and related technology are subject to us export controls, including the us department of commerce’s export administration regulations (also known as “ear”), and we and our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties are also subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by ofac and other us government agencies. we incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our platform, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the us only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. we also offer certain customers a ransomware warranty in addition to their subscriptions, providing coverage in the form of a limited monetary payment if they are affected by a ransomware attack (as specified in our ransomware warranty agreement), and though the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise prohibited to receive such payments under us sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions in violation of our warranty and applicable law. furthermore, us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export and re-export of certain hardware and software and the provision of certain cloud-based solutions to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by us sanctions and for certain end-uses. as an example, following russia’s invasion of ukraine, the us and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against russia and belarus. the us and its allies could expand and strengthen these sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. these restrictions would further impact our ability to do business in certain parts of the world and to do business with certain persons and entities, including selling our services and using local developers. we also collect information about cyber threats from open sources, intermediaries and third parties that we make available to our customers in our threat industry publications. further, regulators in the us and elsewhere have signaled an increased emphasis on sanctions and export control enforcement, including several recent high-profile enforcement actions and increased pressure for companies to self-disclose potential violations. while we have implemented certain procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the collection and distribution of this information, we cannot assure you that these procedures have been effective or that we, or third parties who we do not control, have complied with all laws or regulations in this regard. failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the collection and distribution of this information also could have negative consequences to us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.  although we take precautions to prevent our information collection practices and services from being provided in violation of such laws, our information collection practices and services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws. if we or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets or otherwise. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.  various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries. additionally, export restrictions imposed on russia and belarus specifically limit the export of encryption hardware, software and related source code and technology to these locations which could limit our ability to provide our software and services to these countries. changes in our platform, and changes in or promulgation of new export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 (fcpa), as amended, the united kingdom bribery act 2010 (the bribery act), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the us and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the public, and in certain cases, private sector. we leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents and channel partners, to conduct our business in the us and abroad, to sell subscriptions to our platform and to collect information about cyber threats. we and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries and other third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with fcpa, bribery act and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries or other third parties have not taken, or will not take actions, in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we increase our international sales and business, including our business with government organizations, our risks under these laws may increase. noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from us government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. any investigations, actions or sanctions could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.  moreover, the rapid evolution of ai, including potential government regulation of ai, may require significant additional resources to develop, test, and maintain our platform. our ai-related initiatives may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, including regarding the use of ai in our products and the marketing of products using ai, litigation, customer reporting or documentation requirements, ethical or social concerns, or other complications and may also introduce risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy, and security and data provenance. for example, the european commission’s proposed artificial intelligence act could also impose new obligations or limitations affecting our business, if and when it enters into force. if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. we receive, store, and process personal information from our employees, customers, the employees of our customers, and our end users. this personal information is hosted by our third-party service providers. a wide variety of state, national, and international laws, as well as regulations and industry standards apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information and other information, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent across countries or conflict with other rules. data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in  increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. failure to comply with laws, regulations and industry standards regarding personal information or other information could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems, and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.  in the us, there are numerous federal and state consumer, privacy, and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information, including security breach notification laws and consumer protection laws. each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and constantly evolving. notably, but not necessarily limited to, we may be subject to:  controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (also known as the “can-spam act”) and similar state consumer protection laws regarding the use of telephones and text messaging for marketing purposes.  section 5(a) of the federal trade commission (ftc) act for violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, resulting in a finding of an unfair act or practice.   the ccpa, effective since january 1, 2020, which created new data privacy obligations for covered businesses and provided new privacy rights to california residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. a ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act (cpra) went into force july 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the ccpa, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal data. the cpra also creates a new state agency, known as the california privacy protection agency, which is vested with the authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra. potential uncertainty surrounding the ccpa and cpra may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, particularly in the event of a data breach, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  other states have enacted consumer privacy laws comparable to the ccpa that came into effect in 2023: virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act which became effective january 1, 2023; colorado and connecticut enacted the colorado privacy act and the connecticut personal data privacy and online monitoring act, which both became effective july 1, 2023; utah enacted the utah consumer privacy act, which became effective december 31, 2023. in addition, as of december 31, 2023, eight other states (delaware, indiana, iowa, florida, montana, oregon, tennessee and texas) enacted privacy legislation which will become effective between july 1, 2024 and january 1, 2026. numerous other states also have pending consumer privacy legislation under review, which if enacted, would add additional costs and expense of resources to maintain compliance.  in certain circumstances, we may also be subject to the gdpr (established in 2018 and implemented by countries in the eea) and the uk gdpr, which respectively govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of natural persons, and it applies extra-territorially and imposes onerous requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours). companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global turnover of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. additionally, following the withdrawal by the uk from the eu and the eea, companies must comply with both the gdpr and the uk gdpr as incorporated into uk national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the  greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global annual turnover. in addition to the foregoing, a breach of the gdpr or uk gdpr could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). we may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. the gdpr and uk gdpr requires, among other things, that personal data only be transferred outside of the eea, or the uk, respectively to jurisdictions that have been deemed adequate (also known as “third countries,”) by the european commission or by the uk data protection regulator, respectively. accordingly, personal data may not be transferred to those jurisdictions that have not been deemed adequate, unless steps are taken to legitimize those data transfers. switzerland follows similar legal practices. we rely on the use of standard contractual clauses (sccs), a standard form of contract approved by the european commission, as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism for the transfer of personal data to third countries; however, the sccs may not be alone sufficient to protect data transferred to the us or other third countries under certain circumstances without making a case-by-case basis assessment of the legal regime applicable in the destination country according to the cjeu. on june 28, 2021, the european commission issued an adequacy decision for personal data transfers from the eea to the uk, with a sunset clause of four years, meaning that the european commission will review and renew only if the european commission considers that the uk continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection. notably, the european commission reserved a right to intervene at any time during the four-year adequacy period if the uk deviates from the level of protection then in place. if this adequacy decision is reversed by the european commission, we would have to implement protection measures such as the sccs for personal data transfers between the eu and the uk or find alternative solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data from the eu into the uk in march 2022, the uk information commissioner’s office adopted an international data transfer agreement (idta) for transfers of personal data out of the uk to so-called third countries, as well as an international data transfer addendum (uk scc addendum) that can be used with the sccs for the same purpose.   to add to this complexity, effective on july 10, 2023, the european commission adopted the new eu-us data privacy framework (dpf) which allows for transfers of personal data from the eu to certified companies in the us without the need for additional privacy safeguards as an alternative to the sccs. in october 2023, a uk extension to the dpf (the uk – us data bridge) was adopted enabling the transfer of personal data between the uk and us entities without the need for an idta or uk scc addendum. however, the dpf and the uk – us data bridge could be subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the eu and the uk to the us to become uncertain once again. some countries (including some outside the eea) also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services if we were to operate in those countries. if we are required to implement additional measures to transfer data from the eea, this could increase our compliance costs, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the myriad of international and us privacy and data breach laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. in many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising. in addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. as supervisory authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal information transfers (including regarding data export and circumstances in which we cannot use the sccs), we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines. if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, adversely affecting our financial results, and possibly making it necessary to establish localized storage systems in the eea, switzerland, and the uk to maintain personal data originating from those jurisdictions that adds expenses and may create distractions from our other business pursuits. loss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose"
S,"us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims. we are also subject to evolving eu and uk privacy laws on cookies and electronic marketing. in the eu and the uk, informed opt-in consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. the gdpr also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. while we anticipate the development of the eprivacy regulation to govern cookies and e-marketing, recent european court decisions and regulators’ guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. if regulators start to enforce the strict approach in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. regulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand users. similar concerns may happen under the new cpra regime in california and other current and soon-to-be enacted us state privacy laws.  additionally, by expanding into the eu and uk, we may also trigger article 3(2) of the gdpr/uk gdpr directly as we may be considered to be monitoring data subjects. to the extent we process personal data on behalf of our customers for the provision of services, we have, and may in the future, also be required to enter into data processing agreements which comply with article 28 of the gdpr/uk gdpr. we depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process personal data on our behalf or as our sub-processor. to the extent required by applicable law, we attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using third parties by performing security assessments and detailed due diligence, entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that providers only process personal data according to our instructions or comparable instructions to the instructions of our customer (as applicable), and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. there is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. any violation of privacy, data protection, data or cybersecurity laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties under the gdpr and the uk gdpr outlined above. in recent years, some regulators have proposed or introduced cybersecurity licensing requirements or certification regimes for specific sectors, such as critical infrastructure. these may impose new requirements on us or our current or prospective customer including, but not limited to, data processing locations, breach notification, and security standards. such requirements may cause us to incur significant organizational costs and increase barriers of entry into new markets. new worldwide data protection laws, including in the us and european jurisdictions described above, may lead to changing definitions of personal information and other sensitive information which may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. notably some foreign jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these respective jurisdictions. our failure to comply with applicable laws, directives, and regulations may result in enforcement action against us, including fines, and damage to our reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. any failure or perceived failure by us, even if unfounded, to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to customers, users or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, penalties, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. for example, in 2017, we reached a consent agreement with the ftc, to resolve an investigation relating to certain disclosures in our privacy policy. the consent agreement requires us, among other things, to provide information to the ftc about our compliance with the ftc order and about representations made in our marketing materials. we may be subject to future investigations and legal proceedings  by the ftc or other regulators. as such, it is possible that a regulatory inquiry might result in changes to our policies or business practices. violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, it is possible that future orders issued by, or enforcement actions initiated by, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of our customers’ data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained – or in how these applicable laws, regulations or industry practices are interpreted and enforced by state, federal and international privacy regulators – could require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and fines, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features that make use of the data that our customers voluntarily share with us. any security breach or incident, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus, malware, ransomware, denial of service, credential stuffing attack, supply chain attack, hacking or similar breach involving our networks and systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, could result in the loss of customer data, including personal information, disruption to our operations, significant remediation costs, lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. these attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations, and security breaches and incidents may arise from other sources, such as employee or contractor error or malfeasance. cyber threats are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. as a cybersecurity company, we have been and may continue to be specifically targeted by malicious actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. our industry is experiencing an increase in phishing attacks and unauthorized scans of systems searching for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to exploit. if our security measures are breached or otherwise compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, defect, vulnerability or bug in our products or products of third parties upon which we rely, malfeasance or otherwise, including any such breach or compromise resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our confidential information, including personal information or the personal information of our customers or others, or if any of these are perceived or reported to occur, we may suffer the loss, compromise, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of our or others’ confidential information and personal information, we may face a loss in intellectual property protection, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could be subject to claims, demands, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, indemnity obligations, and otherwise incur significant liability. even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident or breach, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to any security breach or incident. techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. we and our third-party vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with the conflicts in ukraine, the middle east and tensions between china and taiwan, we and our third-party vendors and service providers are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches from nation-state and affiliated actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our and our third-party vendors’ and service providers’ systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our products and services as well as retaliatory cybersecurity attacks from russian and russian-affiliated actors against companies with a us presence. in addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the us and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. we may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain. we and our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security measures and increased risk of suffering cyberattacks,  including ransomware attacks. should we or the third-party vendors and service providers upon which we rely experience such attacks, including from ransomware or other security breaches or incidents, our operations may also be hindered or interrupted due to system disruptions or otherwise, with foreseeable secondary contractual, regulatory, financial and reputational harms that may arise from such an incident. further, we cannot assure that any limitations of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security incident. we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. if our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information, whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the ftc or applicable state attorneys general. our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions, and costly litigation (including class actions). any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are currently in, and may in the future, become involved in litigation that may adversely affect us.  from time to time, we have been subject to claims, suits and other proceedings. for example, we are currently the subject of securities litigation and commercial litigation. for additional information regarding these litigation matters, see the section titled “legal proceedings.” regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,  financial condition, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,"risks related to financial and accounting matters the requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, result in significant costs and may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. as a public company we incur and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the new york stock exchange (nyse). we expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our consolidated financial statements and in the reports that we will file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.  our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired companies may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results, may result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our class a common stock. our management is also required, pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance (esg)-focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. we have incurred significant costs with respect to our directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage. in the future, it may be more expensive or more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. these factors would also  make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. being a public company requires significant resources and management oversight. as a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,"we could be subject to additional tax liabilities and us federal and global income tax reform could adversely affect us.  we are subject to us federal, state, local and sales taxes in the us and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. in addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws in the us or in other jurisdictions in which we operate. for example, the us tax law legislation, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, significantly reformed the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the internal revenue code), reducing us federal tax rates, making sweeping changes to rules governing international business operations, and imposing significant additional limitations on tax benefits, including the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating loss carryforwards. on august 16, 2022, president biden signed the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) into law. the ira contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on certain corporate stock buy-backs taking place after december 31, 2022. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) inclusive framework of 137 jurisdictions have joined a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation rules. the first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between countries for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with global turnover above €20 billion. the second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent applicable to in-scope multinational enterprises and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with annual consolidated group revenue in excess of €750 million. we are still evaluating the impact of the pillar two rules as they continue to be refined by the oecd and implemented by various national governments. however, it is possible that the pillar two rules, as implemented by various national governments, could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.  as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $721.2 million and $390.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for us income tax purposes. if not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. in addition, as of january 31, 2024, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $5.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2037, and state research and development credit carryforwards of $2.9 million, which do not expire. we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $202.8 million, as of january 31, 2024, which do not expire. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that certain of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent  shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. similar rules apply under us state tax laws. we have, and may in the future, experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change us net operating loss carryforwards to offset us federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. we could be required to collect additional sales, use, value added, digital services, or other similar taxes or be subject to other liabilities with respect to past or future sales, that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our solutions and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we do not collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, value added, digital services, or assert other tax collection obligations on us that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  further, an increasing number of us states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. a successful assertion by one or more us states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as interest and penalties. furthermore, certain jurisdictions, such as the uk, france and canada, have enacted a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering enacting similar laws. a successful assertion by a us state or local government, or other country or jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, value added, digital services or other similar taxes could, among other things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage potential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any such sales or other related taxes, or otherwise harm our business. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business and growth in international markets. we generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets, and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. furthermore, increases in tax rates, new or revised tax laws, and new interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, could result in an increase in our overall tax obligations which could adversely affect our business. our intercompany relationships and intercompany transactions are subject to complex transfer pricing rules administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate with potentially divergent tax laws. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions will depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the us, to our intercompany transactions, international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements.  it is not uncommon for tax authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, the transfer pricing and charges for intercompany services and other intercompany transactions, or with respect to the valuation of our intellectual property and the manner in which our intellectual property is utilized within our group. in 2022, we began negotiating a bilateral advance pricing agreement (apa) with the us and the israeli  governments, covering various transfer pricing matters for intercompany transactions relating to the intergroup utilization of our intellectual property among our group enterprises. an apa, if obtained, will provide us with a more predictable future business operating model, and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making certain transfer pricing adjustments within the scope of these agreements. these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. if taxing authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international operations were to successfully challenge our transfer pricing, we could be required to reallocate part or all of our income to reflect transfer pricing adjustments, which could result in an increased tax liability to us. in such circumstances, if the country from where the income was reallocated did not agree to the reallocation, we could become subject to tax on the same income in both countries, resulting in double taxation. furthermore, the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. we believe that our tax and financial accounting positions are reasonable and our tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liability. we also believe that our assumptions, judgements, and estimates are reasonable and that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions are on arm’s-length terms. however, the relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions, including any assumptions, judgements or estimates used for these transfer pricing matters and intercompany transactions. if any of these tax authorities determine that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions do not meet arm’s-length criteria, and were successful in challenging our positions, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties related thereto, which could be in excess of any reserves established therefore, and which could result in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, including in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and such jurisdictions may assess new or additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our operating results could be adversely affected.  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to those related to stock-based compensation, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, useful lives of long-lived assets and intangibles, the valuation of intangibles acquired as part of a business combination, and accounting for income taxes. our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a potential decline in the market price of our class a common stock.  additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. for example, sec proposals on climate-related disclosures may require us to update our accounting or operational policies, processes, or systems to reflect new or amended financial reporting standards. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may adversely affect our financial results.  we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, strengthening of the us dollar increases the real cost of our platform to our customers outside of the us, which could lead to delays in the purchase of our platform and the lengthening of our sales cycle. if the us dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, increased international sales in the future, including through continued international expansion, our channel partners and other partnerships, could result in foreign currency denominated sales, which would increase our foreign currency risk. our operating expenses incurred outside the us and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations but may do so, or use other derivative instruments, in the future. we may require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, and any inability to generate or obtain such capital may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in order to support our growth and respond to business challenges, such as developing new features or enhancements to our platform to stay competitive, acquiring new technologies, and improving our infrastructure, we have made significant financial investments in our business and we intend to continue to make such investments. as a result, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to provide the funds required for these investments and other business endeavors. if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to those of holders of our class a common stock. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. if we obtain additional funds through debt financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us. further, the current global macroeconomic environment may make it more difficult to raise additional capital on favorable terms, it at all. such terms may involve restrictive covenants making it difficult to engage in capital raising activities and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. the trading prices of technology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the conflict in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, inflation, interest rate volatility, actual or perceived instability in the banking system, and market downturns, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. in addition, a recession, depression, or other sustained adverse market event could adversely affect our business and the value of our class a common stock. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be adversely affected, requiring us to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our operations."
S,"risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.  our class a common stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
S," actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;  the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;  rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  the overall performance of the stock market or technology companies;  the number of shares of our class a common stock publicly owned and available for trading;  failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  litigation or other proceedings involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;  developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;  any major changes in our management or our board of directors;  the global political, economic and macroeconomic climate, including but not limited to, actual or perceived instability in the banking industry, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, potential recession, inflation, and rising interest rates;   other events or factors, including those resulting from war, armed conflict, including the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and  cybersecurity incidents.  in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies, particularly during the current period of global macroeconomic uncertainty, including rising inflation, increasing interest rates, labor shortages and fluctuations in international currency rates, as well as the impacts of regional geopolitical conflicts, including the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan. these economic, political, regulatory and market conditions have and may continue to negatively impact the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock into the public market, including shares of class a common stock held by our existing stockholders that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline.  in addition, pursuant to our amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, dated october 28, 2020, certain stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file a registration statement for the public resale of such capital stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other  stockholders. any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline or be volatile.  we may also issue our shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, an investment, or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the holders of our class b common stock who held, in the aggregate, approximately 72% of the voting power of our capital stock as of january 31, 2024, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction.  our class b common stock has 20 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. as of january 31, 2024, the holders of our outstanding class b common stock held approximately 72% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock, the holders of our class b common stock collectively are expected to continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of class b common stock, (ii) seven years from the date of our prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to rule 424(b)(4) under the securities act (the final prospectus), or june 29, 2028, (iii) the first date following the completion of our ipo on which the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) held by tomer weingarten, including certain permitted entities that mr. weingarten controls, is less than 25% of the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) that mr. weingarten originally held as of the date of our final prospectus, (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors, following the first date following the completion of our ipo when mr. weingarten is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, consultant or member of our board of directors, (v) the date fixed by our board of directors following the date on which, if applicable, mr. weingarten is terminated for cause, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, and (vi) the date that is 12 months after the death or disability, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, of mr. weingarten. this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. in addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.  future transfers by holders of our class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of our class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. the dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our class a common stock. we cannot predict whether our dual class structure will, over time, result in a lower or more volatile market price of our class a common stock, adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. certain stock index providers exclude or limit the ability of multi-class share structures from being added to certain indices. in addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. as a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, may discourage such indices from selecting us for inclusion (notwithstanding our automatic termination provision) may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our class a common stock. any exclusion from certain stock indices could result in less demand for our class a common stock. any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our  corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our class a common stock."
S,"general risk factors we may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as war and regional geopolitical conflicts around the world, that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could have an adverse effect on us. our business operations are also subject to interruption by fire, power shortages, flooding, and other events beyond our control. in addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. further, acts of war, armed conflict, terrorism and other geopolitical unrest, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in israel which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our business results of operations and we have implemented continuity measures to address the safety of our employees and continue our operations in the event of reduced employee availability in the conflict region. however, if our continuity measures fail or the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations.  in the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, cyberattack, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in development of our platform, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of such natural disasters. moreover, any of our office locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our corporate offices are located in california, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, heatwaves, and droughts. these events can, in turn, have impacts on inflation risk, food security, water security and on our employees’ health and well-being. additionally, all the aforementioned risks will be further increased if we do not implement an effective disaster recovery plan or our partners’ disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate."
S,"investors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. there is an increasing focus from certain regulators, investors, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to esg matters both in the us and internationally. some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. we may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the esg standards set by various constituencies. further, esg initiatives, goals or commitments could be difficult to achieve or costly to implement. if our competitors’ corporate social responsibility performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. moreover, california recently adopted two new climate-related bills, which require companies doing business in california that meet certain revenue thresholds to publicly disclose certain greenhouse gas emissions data and climate-related financial risk reports, and compliance with such requirements could require significant effort and resources. additionally, in march 2024, the sec enacted comprehensive climate change disclosure rules, which have since been challenged by various third parties. our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities and our related disclosures, including from the investment community, and our failure to achieve progress or manage the dynamic public sentiment and legal  landscape in these areas on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial performance. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.  the trading market for our class a common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our class a common stock or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.  we are currently subject to and can in the future be subject to securities class action litigation. securities class action litigation can be instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. we are currently subject to securities litigation as further described in the section titled “legal proceedings.” this type of litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may make it more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in the future and may require us to opt for lower overall policy limits and coverage or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs, or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. these factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors.  we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock.  we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or other change of control of the company that the stockholders may consider favorable. in addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:  provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;  permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;  authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;  provide that only our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  do not provide for cumulative voting;  provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;  provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our class b common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. moreover, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (dgcl), may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation contains exclusive forum provisions for certain claims, which may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  moreover, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the us will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act (federal forum provision). our decision to adopt a federal forum provision followed a decision by the supreme court of the state of delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under delaware law. while there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the delaware supreme court or determine that the federal forum provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the federal forum provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder. in addition, the federal forum provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act. accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the federal forum provision. these provisions may limit a stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results."
