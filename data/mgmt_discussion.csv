HUBS,item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
HUBS,"the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. as discussed in the section titled “special note regarding forward-looking statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “risk factors” included under part i, item 1a within this annual report on form 10-k."
HUBS,"company overview we provide a customer platform that helps businesses connect and grow better. we deliver seamless connection for customer-facing teams with a unified platform that includes three layers: ai-powered engagement hubs, a smart crm, and a connected ecosystem that extends the customer platform with app marketplace integrations, a community network, and educational content."
HUBS,"our engagement hubs include marketing hub, sales hub, service hub, operations hub, cms hub and commerce hub, as well as other tools and integrations that enable companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. our customer platform features a central database of lead and customer interactions and integrated applications designed to help businesses attract visitors to their websites, convert visitors into leads, close leads into customers, transact with those customers, and delight them so they become promoters of those businesses. the core of our customer platform is our smart crm: a single database of lead and customer information that allows businesses to track their interactions with contacts and customers, manage their customer activities, and report on their pipeline and sales. our customer platform was built to easily and seamlessly integrate third party applications to further customize to an individual company’s industry or needs. as data is becoming more important to our customers’ success and a differentiator for our business, there is a need to move quickly on data enrichment. the acquisition of clearbit will allow us to build enriched b2b records directly into our customer platform. we designed and built our customer platform to serve a broad range of customers globally. our customer platform starts completely free and grows with our customers to meet their needs at different stages in their life-cycles. it supports multiple languages and currencies and offers an array of sophisticated features, including content partitioning at the enterprise level for companies operating in or serving multiple countries. we focus on selling to mid-market business-to-business, or b2b, companies, which we define as companies that have between two and 2,000 employees. while our customer platform was built to grow with any company, we focus on selling to mid-market businesses because we believe we have significant competitive advantages attracting and serving this market segment. these mid-market businesses seek an integrated, easy-to-implement and easy-to-use solution to reach customers and compete with organizations that have larger marketing, sales, and customer service budgets. we efficiently reach these businesses at scale through our proven inbound methodology, our solutions partners, and our “freemium” model. a solutions partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our customer platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid products. as of december 31, 2023, we had 7,663 full-time employees and 205,091 customers of varying sizes in more than 135 countries, representing many industries. our customer platform is a multi-tenant, globally available software-as-a-service product delivered through apis, web browsers or mobile applications. we sell our customer platform on a subscription basis. our total revenue increased to $2.2 billion in 2023, from $1.7 billion in 2022, and from $1.3 billion in 2021, representing year-over-year increases of 25% in 2023 and 33% in 2022. we had net losses of $176.3 million in 2023, $112.7 million in 2022, and $77.8 million in 2021. we derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based customer platform and related professional services, which consist of customer on-boarding, training and consulting services. subscription revenue accounted for 98% of our total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, and 97% of our total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2021. we sell multiple product plans at different base prices on a subscription basis, each of which includes our smart crm and integrated applications to meet the needs of the various customers we serve. customers pay additional fees if the number of contacts stored and tracked in the customer’s database exceeds specified thresholds. we also generate additional revenue based on the purchase of additional subscriptions and products, and the number of account users and subdomains. most of our customers’ subscriptions are one year or less in duration. subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. because the mix of billing terms for orders can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the orders we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. accordingly, we do not believe that change in deferred revenue is an accurate indicator of future revenue. many of our customers purchase on-boarding, training, and consulting services, as well as other tools, which are designed to help customers enhance their ability to attract, engage and delight their customers using our customer platform. we also generate revenue from commerce hub and a number of revenue-share agreements with other companies based on mutually agreed upon terms. professional services and other revenue accounted for 2% of total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, and 3% of total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2021. we have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue to make investments to help us address some of the challenges facing us to support this growth, such as demand for our customer platform by existing and new customers, significant competition from other providers of marketing, sales, customer service, operations, commerce, and content management software and related applications and rapid technological change in our industry. we believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, increase adoption of our customer platform within existing customers, develop new products and applications to extend the functionality of our customer platform and provide a high level of customer service. we have invested and intend to continue investing for long-term growth. we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to support our growth. we plan to continue to invest in research and development as we continue to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of our customer platform. we intend to continue maintaining a high level of customer service and support which we consider critical for our continued success. we also plan to continue investing in our data center infrastructure and services capabilities in order to support continued future customer growth. we also expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of both our growth and the infrastructure required to be a public company. we expect to use our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our convertible debt to fund these growth strategies and support our business."
HUBS,"global economic conditions our results of operations may be significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), geo-political conflicts, foreign currency fluctuations, interest rates, inflation, recession risks, existing and new domestic and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are beyond our control. fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and rising inflation have had, and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results in future periods. as we continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. see part i, item 1a. ""risk factors"" for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of pandemics, geo-politcal conflicts, and other general macroeconomic impacts on our business."
HUBS,"key business metrics the following key business metrics are presented in this annual report on form 10-k or in our press releases announcing our financial results which are furnished on form 8-k. we use these key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and results of operations, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. these key business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar key business metrics used by other companies."

HUBS,"customers. we believe that our ability to increase our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities as we continue to expand our sales force and invest in marketing efforts. we define our customers at the end of a particular period as the number of business entities with one or more paid subscriptions to our customer platform either purchased directly with us or purchased from a solutions partner. we do not include in customers any legacy piesync or clearbit products. a single customer may have separate paid subscriptions to our customer platform, but we count these as one customer if certain customer-provided information such as company name, url, or email address indicate that these subscriptions are managed by the same business entity. average subscription revenue per customer. we believe that our ability to increase the average subscription revenue per customer is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our existing customer relationships. we define average subscription revenue per customer during a particular period as subscription revenue, excluding revenue from our legacy piesync and clearbit products, from our customers during the period divided by the average customers during the same period. net revenue retention. we believe that our ability to retain and expand a customer relationship is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customers. net revenue retention is a measure of the percentage of recurring revenue retained from customers over a given period of time. our net revenue retention for a given period is calculated by first dividing retained subscription revenue by retention base revenue in the given period, calculating the weighted average of these rates using the retention base revenue for the period, and then annualizing the resulting rates. a definition of each of the key terms used to calculate net revenue retention is included below. retained subscription revenue. contractual monthly subscription revenue of the same cohort of customers as those that comprise the retention base revenue at the end of the same month. retention base revenue. contractual monthly subscription revenue of our customers as of the beginning of each month. contractual monthly subscription revenue. the subscription fees contractually committed to be paid for a full month under our customer agreements, converted into usd at fixed rates that are held consistent over time, excluding commissions owed to our solutions partners."
HUBS,key components of consolidated statements of operations
HUBS,"revenue we derive our revenue from two major sources, revenue from subscriptions to our customer platform and professional services and other revenue consisting mainly of on-boarding, training, and consulting services fees."
HUBS,"subscription based revenue is derived from customers using our customer platform for their inbound marketing, sales, service, operations, and content management needs. our customer platform includes a system of engagement for efficiently engaging customers through seo, web content, social, blogging, email, marketing automation, messaging, support ticketing, knowledge base, commerce, conversation routing, video hosting, and data enrichment. over 1,500 integrations and applications are available for our users, across a wide range of categories, including integrations with leading social media, email, sales, video, analytics, content and webinar tools. all subscription fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. subscription based revenue is recognized net of consideration paid to solutions partners when those solutions partners purchase a subscription to our customer platform. professional services and other revenue are derived primarily from customer on-boarding, training, and consulting services. depending on which hubs and services a customer purchases, they receive on-boarding guidance or one-on-one training from one of our on-boarding, inbound consultants, or technical consultants by web meetings. training is generally sold in connection with a customer’s initial subscription and is billed in advance. the training is also available to be purchased separately following a customer’s purchase of its initial subscription and our solutions partners routinely provide the same training to customers. we also derive revenue from commerce hub and a number of revenue-share agreements with other companies based on mutually agreed upon terms."
HUBS,"cost of revenue, operating and other expenses"
HUBS,"cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our customer support team, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which we define as facilities, depreciation of fixed assets, and costs related to information technology. cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platform, as well as professional fees and allocated overhead costs, which we define as facilities, depreciation of fixed assets, and costs related to information technology."
HUBS,"we expect that the cost of subscription and professional services and other revenue will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing our business. over time, we expect to gain benefits of scale associated with our costs of hosting our customer platform relative to subscription revenues, resulting in improved subscription gross margin, exclusive of stock-based compensation. we expect professional services and other margins to breakeven for the foreseeable future, exclusive of stock-based compensation."
HUBS,"research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, professional and contractor fees and allocated overhead costs. we capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our customer platform and amortize such costs as costs of subscription and cost of professional services and other revenue over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally two years. we also capitalize certain development costs that are attributable to developing our internally developed software platforms and amortize such costs throughout the consolidated statement of operations over the estimated life of our internally developed software platforms, which is generally five years. we focus our research and development efforts on improving our products and developing new ones, delivering new functionality and enhancing the customer experience. we believe delivering new functionality for our customers is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to a broad array of options and information critical to their marketing, sales, and customer service efforts. we expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers’ experience and satisfaction and attract new customers. over time, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase the functionality of our customer platform and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation expense. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual inbound conference, other brand building expenses, amortization of intangible assets, professional and contractor fees and allocated overhead costs. sales and marketing expenses also include commissions paid to our solutions partners in instances where the end customer purchases and pays for a subscription to our customer platform. we defer certain sales and solutions partner commissions related to acquiring new contracts and amortize them ratably over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately two to four years. we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. this growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate leads and build brand awareness. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop our sales and marketing teams. over time, we expect sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, employee-related information technology, administrative personnel, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, and allocated overhead costs. we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis and remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation expense, as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. we also anticipate continuing increases to general and administrative expenses as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including audit and consulting fees. restructuring restructuring expenses primarily consist primarily of lease consolidation charges and personnel costs, such as employee severance payments, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, associated with our workforce reduction, which are described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k"
HUBS,"other income (expense) interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents balances and investments. interest expense primarily consists of amortization of the debt discount, issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our notes, and the loss on early extinguishment of our 2022 notes. on january 1, 2022, we adopted the new guidance for convertible instruments"
HUBS,"which eliminates the recognition of the debt discount and losses on early extinguishment. in 2023 and 2022, interest expense consisted of amortization of issuance costs and contract interest expense related to our notes. other income (expense) primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities and any gains or impairments on our strategic investments."
HUBS,"income tax expense income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes for u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. we have a history of losses in our most significant jurisdiction, the u.s., and a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets."

HUBS,"subscription revenue increased during 2022 due to the increase in customers, which grew from 135,442 as of december 31, 2021 to 167,386 as of december 31, 2022. average subscription revenue per customer increased from $10,486 for the year ended december 31, 2021 to $11,163 for the year ended december 31, 2022. the growth in customers was primarily driven by our increased demand for our lower-priced starter products. the increase in average subscription revenue per customer was primarily driven by a continued demand for our professional and enterprise products, partially offset by continued purchases of our lower-priced starter products and the impact of foreign currency translation primarily attributable to the decline in the value of the euro and british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar. professional services and other revenue decreased during 2022 primarily due to non-recurring advertising revenue generated from our acquisition of hustle con media, inc. (“hustle”) in the first quarter of 2021, lower overall services revenue from on-boardings and trainings, and lower fees earned from revenue share arrangements with third parties, partially offset by fees earned from other revenue streams. 56"

HUBS,liquidity and capital resources considerations
HUBS,"contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered during our course of business. our contractual obligations consist of operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and vendor commitments associated with agreements that are legally binding. as of december 31, 2023, the total obligation for operating leases was $405.1 million, of which $54.6 million is expected in the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2023, our vendor commitment was $848.7 million, of which $213.2 million is expected in the next twelve months. see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report."
HUBS,"convertible senior notes as of december 31, 2023, the carrying value was $456.2 million for our 2025 notes. the interest rate is fixed at 0.375% for the 2025 notes. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year for both notes. see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report."
HUBS,"letters of credit as of december 31, 2023, we had a total of $4.1 million in letters of credit outstanding for office space. these irrevocable letters of credit are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2029."
HUBS,"off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2023 or 2022 exclusive of items described above and indemnifications of officers, directors and employees for certain events or occurrences while the officer, director or employee is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity."
HUBS,"critical accounting policies and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. these estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates."
HUBS,"we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity."
HUBS,"revenue recognition we generate revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to our online software solutions and professional and other services which include on-boarding, training, consulting services and our commerce hub. our customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the online software product is made available to customers. we recognize revenue from on-boarding, training, consulting services, and commerce hub as the services are provided. amounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“ssp”) of each good or service. we calculate ssp for each type of online software product and professional service offering by averaging the selling price of all purchases within the trailing four calendar quarters. we generally use four quarters of transaction data to determine ssp as most of our customer arrangements are one year or less and pricing may be subject to change upon each customer’s renewal. in instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the average selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service offering are disparate, we estimate the ssp using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. if the actual selling price for the sale of an online software product or professional service offering within a multiple performance"
HUBS,"obligation arrangement substantially differs from the ssp of that offering, we use the relative ssp to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. costs to obtain a contract with a customer sales commissions earned by our sales force and solutions partners are considered incremental, recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately two to four years. the two to four-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the company’s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. while we do not anticipate any significant changes to the two to four year amortization period, if a change did occur it could produce a material impact on our financial statements. for example, if the commitment term of our customer contracts significantly increased, our deferred commission expense asset would increase, and our amortization expense would decrease in the period in which the change occurs."
HUBS,"capitalized software development costs software development costs consist of certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for our customer platform and internally-built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality. we capitalize certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to our existing software platforms, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining our customer platform and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred. we amortize these development costs over the estimated useful life of two to five years on a straight-line basis. we determined that a two- to five- year life is appropriate for our internal-use software based on our best estimate of the useful life of the internally developed software after considering factors such as continuous developments in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades. management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets."
HUBS,we determine the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the application stage of development. there is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. a significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods.
HUBS,"leases we lease office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through february 2035. certain leases contain optional termination dates. we determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and do not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. operating leases with a duration of 12 months or less are excluded from right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities and related expenses are recorded as incurred. we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. to determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, we use publicly available credit ratings for peer companies, and estimate the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. significant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as intangible assets and their estimated useful lives. fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. particularly for the acquisition of clearbit, management applied judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology intangible asset, which involved estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasted revenue growth rates, the revenue attributable to the acquired intangible asset over its estimated economic life and the discount rate. these judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating the purchase price consideration to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as our current and future operating results. actual results may vary from these estimates that may result in adjustments to goodwill and"
HUBS,"acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results."

use cases with minimal latency. the storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. the cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case’s performance requirements with no administration. this architecture is built on three major public clouds across 40 regional deployments around the world. these deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the data cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience. we generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. for compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. for storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer’s data stored in our platform. for data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed. our customers typically enter into capacity arrangements with a term of one to four years, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. when this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. when a customer’s consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. for these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period. our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving increased use of our platform for existing customers. we primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and primarily sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. our sales force is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the industry, size, and region of prospective customers. once our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 131% and 158% as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. see the section titled “key business metrics” for a definition of net revenue retention rate. our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. as of january 31, 2024, we had 9,437 total customers, increasing from 7,744 customers as of january 31, 2023. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. our platform has been adopted by many of the world’s largest organizations that view snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. as of january 31, 2024, our customers included 691 of the forbes global 2000, based on the 2023 forbes global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024. our forbes global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the global 2000 list by forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our forbes global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january 31. for example, references to fiscal 2024 refer to the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024."
SNOW,"impact of macroeconomic conditions our business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates. these conditions have caused, and may continue to cause, customers to rationalize budgets, prioritize cash flow management, including through shortened contract duration, and optimize consumption, including by reducing storage through shorter data retention policies. we are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of general macroeconomic conditions across our business. for additional details, see the section titled “risk factors.” stock repurchase program"
SNOW,"in february 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. the program is funded using our working capital and will expire in march 2025. during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $591.7 million, including transaction costs, at a weighted-average price of $147.50 per share. all repurchases were made in open market transactions (including via pre-set trading plans). as of january 31, 2024, $1.4 billion remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase program. see note 11, “equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details. the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. business combinations during the three months ended january 31, 2024, we acquired all outstanding stock of samooha, inc. (samooha), a privately-held company which developed data clean room technology that enabled multiple parties to securely collaborate on sensitive data. the acquisition date fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was $219.0 million, which was primarily comprised of 0.9 million shares of our common stock valued at $174.2 million as of the acquisition date, $38.8 million fair value of our previously held equity interest in samooha, and $6.0 million in cash and deferred cash consideration. in addition, we issued to certain of samooha’s employees a total of 0.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for a portion of their samooha stock. these shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over four years, subject to each of these employees’ continued employment with the company or its affiliates. the $74.8 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of four years. during the three months ended july 31, 2023, we acquired all outstanding stock of neeva inc. and its equity investee (collectively, neeva), a privately-held company which developed search technology powered by artificial intelligence language models, for $185.4 million in cash. during the three months ended april 30, 2023, we acquired (i) all outstanding stock of mountain us corporation (formerly known as mobilize.net corporation) (mountain), a privately-held company which provided a suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the data cloud, for $76.3 million in cash, and (ii) all outstanding stock of leapyear technologies, inc. (leapyear), a privately-held company which provided a differential privacy platform, for $62.0 million in cash. the results of operations of these business combinations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. see note 7, “business combinations,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for details regarding these business combinations. key factors affecting our performance adoption of our platform and expansion of the data cloud our future success depends in large part on the market adoption of our platform, including new product functionality such as snowpark. while we see growing demand for our platform, particularly from large enterprises, many of these organizations have invested substantial technical, financial, and personnel resources in their legacy database products or big data offerings, despite their inherent limitations. in addition, many customers are attempting to rationalize budgets, prioritize cash flow management, and optimize consumption amidst macroeconomic uncertainty. while this makes it difficult to predict customer adoption rates and future demand, we believe that the benefits of our platform put us in a strong position to capture the significant market opportunity ahead. our platform powers the data cloud, a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers that enables our customers to securely share, monetize, and acquire live data sets and data products. the data cloud includes access to the snowflake marketplace, through which customers can access or acquire third-party data sets, data applications, and other data products. our future growth is increasingly dependent on our ability to increase consumption of our platform by building and expanding the data cloud."
SNOW,"expanding within our existing customer base our large base of customers represents a significant opportunity for further consumption of our platform. while we have seen an increase in the number of customers that have contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue growing these customers further, as well as continuing to expand the usage of our platform within our other existing customers. we plan to continue investing to encourage increased consumption and adoption of new use cases among our existing customers, particularly large enterprises. once deployed, our customers often expand their use of our platform more broadly within the enterprise and across their ecosystem of customers and partners as they migrate more data to the public cloud, identify new use cases, and realize the benefits of our platform and the data cloud. however, because we generally recognize product revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer. in any given period, there is a risk that customer consumption of our platform will be slower than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. new software releases or hardware improvements, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, may make our platform more efficient, enabling customers to consume fewer compute, storage, and data transfer resources to accomplish the same workloads. in addition, new product features allow customers to use our platform to provide compute services without requiring them to store data. to the extent these improvements do not result in an offsetting increase in new workloads, we may experience lower revenue. our ability to increase usage of our platform by, and sell additional contracted capacity to, existing customers, and, in particular, large enterprise customers, will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing, macroeconomic conditions, overall changes in our customers’ spending levels, customers’ attempts to optimize their consumption, the effectiveness of our and our partners’ efforts to help our customers realize the benefits of our platform, and the extent to which customers migrate new workloads to our platform over time, including data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning workloads. acquiring new customers we believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base by continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and brand awareness. our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including the productivity of our sales organization, competitive dynamics in our target markets, changes in our customers’ spending and platform consumption in response to market uncertainty, and our ability to build and maintain partner relationships, including with global system integrators, resellers, technology partners, and third-party providers of native applications on the snowflake marketplace. while our platform is built for organizations of all sizes, we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers, customers with vast amounts of data, and customers requiring industry-specific solutions. we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel; if our sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time and maintain productivity; or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective."
SNOW,"investing in growth and scaling our business we are focused on our long-term revenue potential and believe our market opportunity is large. we will continue to invest significantly in research and development to improve our platform, including in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. in addition, we are focused on expanding our business both domestically and internationally. as part of these efforts, we are investing in meeting the needs of organizations in geographies and specialized industries that have heightened data requirements, including with respect to data localization, privacy, and security. we intend to continue to invest heavily to grow our business to take advantage of our expansive market opportunity, while also focusing on profitability and cash flow."

(2)cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were $380.8 million and $184.6 million for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. no equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended january 31, 2023. (3)historical numbers for (i) net revenue retention rate, (ii) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, and (iii) forbes global 2000 customers reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. in addition, our forbes global 2000 customer count reflects adjustments for annual updates to the forbes global 2000 list by forbes. (4)as of january 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were approximately $5.2 billion, of which we expect approximately 50% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending january 31, 2025 based on historical customer consumption patterns. the weighted-average remaining life of our capacity contracts was 2.2 years as of january 31, 2024. however, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers' future consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. in addition, our historical customer consumption patterns are not necessarily indicative of future results."
SNOW,"product revenue product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms. product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources, which are consumed by customers on our platform as a single, integrated offering. customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. because customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases, the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value derived from our platform. while customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers’ historical usage to plan and determine financial forecasts. product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue, which has been less than 10% of revenue for each of the periods presented."
SNOW,"net revenue retention rate we believe the growth in use of our platform by our existing customers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. we monitor our dollar-based net revenue retention rate to measure this growth. to calculate this metric, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the trailing two years from our current period end. next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. the cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a reseller arrangement. we then calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period. any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero product revenue in the second year. our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of capacity contracts within a customer’s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. we expect our net revenue retention rate to decrease over the long-term as customers that have consumed our platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and our product revenue that we use to calculate net revenue retention rate, and as their consumption growth primarily relates to existing use cases rather than new use cases. in addition, we have seen, and may continue to see, impacts on customer consumption patterns due to holidays and certain of our customers increasing their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than expected, which may negatively impact our net revenue retention rate in future periods. customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million large customer relationships lead to scale and operating leverage in our business model. compared with smaller customers, large customers present a greater opportunity for us to sell additional capacity because they have larger budgets, a wider range of potential use cases, and greater potential for migrating new workloads to our platform over time. as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract large enterprises to our platform, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. for purposes of determining our customer count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. we do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. forbes global 2000 customers we believe that the number of forbes global 2000 customers is an important indicator of the growth of our business and future revenue trends as we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers and customers with vast amounts of data. our forbes global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the 2023 forbes global 2000 list. our forbes global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list by forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our forbes global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments."
SNOW,"free cash flow we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our core business operations. the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap, for the periods presented (in millions):"

SNOW,"remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligations (rpo) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. rpo excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. portions of rpo that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into u.s. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. rpo is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of customers’ consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. moreover, rpo is influenced by a number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. due to these factors, it is important to review rpo in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere herein. components of results of operations"
SNOW,"revenue we deliver our platform over the internet as a service. customers choose to consume our platform under either capacity arrangements, in which they commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of our revenue is derived, we typically bill our customers annually in advance of their consumption. however, in future periods, we expect to see an increase in capacity contracts providing for quarterly upfront billings and monthly in arrears billings as our customers increasingly want to align consumption and timing of payments. revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to customers with lower usage levels or overage consumption beyond a customer’s contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer’s contract. revenue from on-demand arrangements represented approximately 3%, 2%, and 3% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. we recognize revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. in limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. we recognize the deployment fee ratably over the contract term. such deployment revenue represented less than 1% of our revenue for all periods presented. our customer contracts for capacity typically have a term of one to four years. the weighted-average term of capacity contracts entered into during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024 is approximately 2.6 years. to the extent our customers enter into such contracts and either consume our platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue to use our platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. in many cases, our customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. for those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, our on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or us. we generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. we do not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on our platform. for compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. for storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer’s data stored in our platform. for data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed. because customers have flexibility in their consumption, and we generally recognize revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer contract that typical subscription-based software companies may have. as our customer base grows, we expect our ability to forecast customer consumption in the aggregate to improve. however, in any given period, there is a risk that customers will consume our platform more slowly than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. our revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists primarily of consulting, technical solution services, and training related to our platform. our professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. other revenue consists primarily of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. allocation of overhead costs overhead costs that are not substantially dedicated for use by a specific functional group are allocated based on headcount. such costs include costs associated with office facilities, depreciation of property and equipment, information technology (it) and general recruiting related expenses and other expenses, such as software and subscription services."
SNOW,"cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of professional services and other revenue. cost of revenue also includes allocated overhead costs. cost of product revenue. cost of product revenue consists primarily of (i) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with our customers’ use of our platform and the deployment and maintenance of our platform on public clouds, including different regional deployments, and (ii) personnel-related costs associated with customer support and maintaining service availability and security of our platform, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. we periodically receive credits from third-party cloud providers that are recorded as a reduction to the third-party cloud infrastructure expenses. cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our customer support team and our engineering team responsible for maintaining our platform. cost of professional services and other revenue. cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, amortization of an acquired intangible asset, and costs of contracted third-party partners and software tools. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and professional services organizations to support the growth of our business. some of these investments, including certain support costs and costs of expanding our business internationally, are incurred in advance of generating revenue, and either the failure to generate anticipated revenue or fluctuations in the timing of revenue could affect our gross margin from period to period. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions. a portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the level of the customers’ consumption of our platform, and a portion of the commissions paid to the sales force is earned upon the origination of the customer contracts. sales commissions tied to customers’ consumption are expensed in the same period as they are earned. sales commissions and referral fees earned upon the origination of the new customer or customer expansion contracts are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that we determined to be five years. as our go-to-market motion evolves, more sales personnel will be compensated based on the level of the customers’ consumption of our platform. as a result, we will defer less sales commissions, and we expect that our expenses associated with sales commissions tied to customers’ consumption will increase during the fiscal year ending january 31, 2025. sales and marketing expenses also include advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs, including our user conferences such as data cloud summit and data cloud world tour, offset by proceeds from such conferences and programs. in addition, sales and marketing expenses are comprised of travel-related expenses, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organizations, amortization of an acquired intangible asset, and outside services contracted for sales and marketing purposes. we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense for the foreseeable future as we grow our business. however, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses."
SNOW,"research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. research and development expenses also include contractor or professional services fees, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization. we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our platform. however, we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses. in addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software development costs are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, facilities, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. general and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, and other professional services fees, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative functions, insurance, unallocated lease costs associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, and other corporate expenses. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses. interest income interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to our available-for-sale marketable debt securities, net of associated fees. other income (expense), net other income (expense), net consists primarily of (i) net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on our strategic investments in equity securities, and (ii) the effect of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances. provision for (benefit from) income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and u.s. federal and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. we maintain a full valuation allowance against our u.s. and u.k. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of snowflake inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which we have a controlling financial interest. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the net income (loss) of our majority-owned subsidiary attributed to noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. see note 2, “basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details."

SNOW,"product revenue increased $728.1 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased consumption of our platform by existing customers, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 131% as of january 31, 2024. the increase in product revenue was also driven by an increase in capacity consumption prices of approximately 3% for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased consumption of higher-priced editions of our platform and better discipline over discounting. we had 461 customers with product revenue of greater than $1 million for the trailing 12 months ended january 31, 2024, an increase from 331 customers as of january 31, 2023. such customers represented approximately 65% and 63% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. within these customers, we had 83 and 26 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended january 31, 2024. the substantial majority of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements, which represented approximately 97% and 96% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. the remainder was derived from new customers under capacity arrangements and on-demand arrangements. the preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. for purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. professional services and other revenue increased $12.8 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform. cost of revenue, gross profit (loss), and gross margin"

SNOW,"cost of product revenue increased $153.7 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $78.2 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses as a result of increased customer consumption of our platform. personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs also increased $33.3 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to new and existing employees. the remaining increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs."
SNOW,"our product gross margin was 74% for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to 72% for the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) higher volume-based discounts for our purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure, and (ii) increased cost efficiency as a result of cloud infrastructure processor improvements. while we expect our product gross margin to slightly improve for the fiscal year ending january 31, 2025, a number of factors could hinder any improvement in our product gross margin, including (i) fluctuations in the mix and timing of customers’ consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, (ii) whether or not a customer contracts with us through public cloud marketplaces, (iii) our discounting practices, including as a result of changes to the competitive environment, and (iv) the extent of our investments in our operations, including performance improvements that may make our platform or the underlying cloud infrastructure more efficient. cost of professional services and other revenue increased $27.4 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $26.0 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. the overall increase in cost of professional services and other revenue was also driven by increased amortization of an acquired developed technology intangible asset as a result of the mountain business combination completed in february 2023, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with contracted third-party partners. professional services and other gross margin declined for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to overall increased costs from scaling our professional services organization, including increased headcount and amortization of an acquired developed technology intangible asset as a result of the mountain business combination. however, we do not believe the year-over-year changes in professional services and other gross margins are meaningful given that our professional services and other revenue represents a small percentage of our revenue. sales and marketing"

SNOW,"liquidity and capital resources as of january 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $4.8 billion. our investments primarily consist of u.s. government and agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. as of january 31, 2024, our rpo was $5.2 billion. our rpo represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but that are not recorded on the balance sheet. portions of rpo that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into u.s. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. since inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. our ipo resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts of $121.7 million. we also received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million related to certain concurrent private placements, and did not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that were sold in these private placements. our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, sales and marketing expenses, overhead costs, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and repurchases of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program. as of january 31, 2024, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments related primarily to (i) third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, (ii) operating leases for office facilities, and (iii) subscription arrangements used to facilitate our operations at the enterprise level. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. for more information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments as of january 31, 2024, see note 10, “commitments and contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our long-term purchase commitments may be satisfied earlier than the payment periods presented as we continue to grow and scale our business. in february 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. the program is funded using our working capital and will expire in march 2025. the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2024, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $591.7 million, including transaction costs, at a weighted-average price of $147.50 per share. all repurchases were made in open market transactions (including via pre-set trading plans). as of january 31, 2024, $1.4 billion remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase program. see note 11, “equity,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional details. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, as well as cash flows expected to be generated by our operations, will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and repurchases of our common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, for the next 12 months and beyond. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, our existing commitments to our third-party cloud providers, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, the continuing market adoption of our platform, and the volume and timing of our stock repurchases. we may continue to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. we may, as a result of those arrangements or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. in the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition."

SNOW,"critical accounting estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. by their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected. the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 2, “basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we believe that the accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition and business combinations involve a substantial degree of judgment and complexity and therefore are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. revenue recognition many of our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (ssp) basis. we consider our evaluation of ssp to be a critical accounting estimate. an observable ssp is established based on the price at which a service is sold separately. if an ssp is not observable through past transactions, we estimate it by maximizing the use of observable inputs, including the overall pricing strategy, market data, internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations, and other observable inputs. as our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of our offerings, and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain ssp. changes in ssp could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. these factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a given period. business combinations when we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. these estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, our assessment of the information, and historical experience. our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. the amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. recent accounting pronouncements see note 2, “basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements."

cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers. when we started crowdstrike, cyberattackers had an asymmetric advantage over legacy cybersecurity products that could not keep pace with the rapid changes in adversary tactics. we took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the ai-native crowdstrike falcon xdr platform – the first, true cloud-native platform built with ai at the core, capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent. we believe our approach has defined a new category called the security cloud, which has the power to transform the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. using cloud-scale ai, our security cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, devops, it assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. the more data that is fed into our falcon platform, the more intelligent our security cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide. our go-to-market strategy we sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules to organizations across multiple industries. we primarily sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners. our direct sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints. we have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. when customers deploy our falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and easily add additional cloud modules. once customers experience the benefits of our falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. we also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land-and-expand model. by segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers. we began as a solution for large enterprises, but the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform has enabled us to seamlessly offer our solution to customers of any size. we have expanded our sales focus to include any sized organization without the need to modify our falcon platform for small and medium sized businesses. a substantial majority of our customers purchase subscriptions with a term of one year. our subscriptions are generally priced on a per-endpoint and per-module basis. we recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription. we also generate revenue from our incident response and proactive professional services, which are generally priced on a time and materials basis. we view our professional services business primarily as an opportunity to cross-sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules. certain factors affecting our performance adoption of our solutions. we believe our future success depends in large part on the growth in the market for cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions. many organizations have not yet abandoned the on-premise legacy products in which they have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and maintain. as a result, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our cloud-based solutions. new customer acquisition. our future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire new customers. if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline. we believe that our go-to-market strategy and the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform allow us to rapidly expand our customer base. our incident response and proactive services also help drive new customer acquisitions, as many of these professional services customers subsequently purchase subscriptions to our falcon platform. many organizations have not yet adopted cloud-based security solutions, and since our falcon platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes, worldwide, and across industries, we believe this presents a significant opportunity for growth. maintain customer retention and increase sales. our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase the arr of their subscriptions. we focus on increasing sales to our existing customers by expanding their deployments to more endpoints and selling additional cloud modules for increased functionality. over time we have transitioned our platform from a single offering into highly-integrated offerings of multiple cloud modules. invest in growth. we believe that our market opportunity is large and requires us to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing efforts to further grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. our open cloud architecture and single data model have allowed us to rapidly build and deploy new cloud modules, and we expect to continue investing in those efforts to further enhance our technology platform and product functionality. in addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our falcon platform, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets. furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future given the additional expenses for accounting, compliance, and investor relations as we grow as a public company. key metrics we monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions."
CRWD,"annual recurring revenue (“arr”) arr is calculated as the annualized value of our customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. to the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, we continue to include that revenue in arr if we are actively in discussion with such organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies us that it is not renewing its subscription."
CRWD,the following table sets forth our arr as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):
CRWD,"as of january 31, 2024 2023 annual recurring revenue $3,435,150 $2,559,694 year-over-year growth 34 % 48 %"
CRWD,"arr increased 34% year-over-year and grew to $3.4 billion as of january 31, 2024, of which $875.5 million was net new arr added during fiscal 2024. arr increased 48% year-over-year and grew to $2.6 billion as of january 31, 2023, of which $828.4 million was net new arr added during fiscal 2023. dollar-based net retention rate our dollar-based net retention rate compares our arr from a set of subscription customers against the same metric for those subscription customers from the prior year. our dollar-based net retention rate reflects customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn, and excludes revenue from our incident response and proactive services. we calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of period end by starting with the arr from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or prior period arr. we then calculate the arr from these same subscription customers as of the current period end, or current period arr. current period arr includes any expansion and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing 12 months but excludes revenue from new subscription customers in the current period. we then divide the current period arr by the prior period arr to arrive at our dollar-based net retention rate. for the purposes of calculating our dollar-based net retention rate, we define a subscription customer as a separate legal entity that has entered into a distinct subscription agreement for access to our falcon platform for which the term has not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract. we do not consider our channel partners as customers, and we treat managed service security providers, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. our dollar-based net retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in a given period, which may reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in subsequent periods if the customer makes a larger upfront purchase and does not continue to increase the size of their purchases."

CRWD,"cost of revenue subscription cost of revenue. subscription cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our cloud-based falcon platform in data centers, amortization of our capitalized internal-use software, employee-related costs such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees, property and equipment depreciation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs. as new customers subscribe to our platform and existing subscription customers increase the number of endpoints on our falcon platform, our cost of revenue will increase due to greater cloud hosting costs related to powering new cloud modules and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules and employee-related costs. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud platform and our customer support organizations as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. professional services cost of revenue. professional services cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, technology, property and equipment depreciation, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs. gross profit and gross margin gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new subscription customers, renewals from existing subscription customers, sales of additional modules to existing subscription customers, the data center and bandwidth costs associated with operating our cloud platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support and cloud operations organizations, and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology, infrastructure, and data centers through technological improvements. we expect our gross profit to increase in dollar amount and our gross margin to increase modestly over the long term, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. demand for our incident response services is driven by the number of breaches experienced by non-customers. also, we view our professional services solutions in the context of our larger business and as a significant lead generator for new subscriptions. because of these factors, our services revenue and gross margin may fluctuate over time. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general administrative expenses. for each of these categories of expense, employee-related expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, employee bonuses, sales commissions, and employer payroll tax. operating expenses also include an allocated portion of overhead costs for facilities and it. sales and marketing. sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, and bonuses. sales and marketing expenses also include stock-based compensation; expenses related to our fal.con customer conference and other marketing events; an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired intangibles; and cloud hosting and related services costs related to proof of value efforts. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and any other incremental payments made upon the initial acquisition of a subscription or upsells to existing customers, which are capitalized and amortized over the estimated customer life. we also capitalize and amortize any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription over the term of the renewal. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base. however, we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses. research and development. research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation; cloud hosting and related costs; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses. our cloud platform is software-driven, and our research and development teams employ software engineers in the design, and the related development, testing, certification, and support of these solutions. we expect research and development expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to increase investments in our technology architecture and software platform. however, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses. general and administrative. general and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses; stock-based compensation; and related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees; and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses. we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount over time. however, we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses. interest expense. interest expense consists primarily of amortization of debt issuance costs, contractual interest expense for our senior notes issued in january 2021, and amortization of debt issuance costs on our secured revolving credit facility."
CRWD,"interest income. interest income consists primarily of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. other income, net. other income, net consists primarily of gain and losses on strategic investments, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes consists of state income taxes in the united states, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes related to customer payments in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. we maintain a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, which we have determined are not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. we regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance. due to recent profitability, a material reversal of our valuation allowance in u.s. jurisdictions in the foreseeable future is reasonably possible. net income attributable to non-controlling interest. net income attributable to non-controlling interest consists of the falcon funds’ non-controlling interest share of gains and losses and interest income from our strategic investments."
CRWD,"liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity as of january 31, 2024, consisted of: (i) $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which mainly consists of cash on hand and highly liquid investments in money market funds and u.s. treasury bills, (ii) $99.6 million in short-term investments, which consists of u.s. treasury bills, (iii) cash we expect to generate from operations, and (iv) available capacity under our $750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “a&r credit agreement”). we expect that the combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and the a&r credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) interest and principal payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, (iv) research and development and capital expenditure needs, and (v) license and service arrangements integral to our business operations. our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. we have historically generated operating losses prior to fiscal 2024, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion as of january 31, 2024. we expect to continue to make investments, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. as a result, we may require additional capital resources in the future to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. we typically invoice our subscription customers annually in advance. therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. deferred revenue primarily consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. as of january 31, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $3.1 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. we do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions, or foreign currency forward contracts. cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):"

CRWD,"strategic investments in july 2019, we agreed to commit up to $10.0 million to a newly formed entity, crowdstrike falcon fund llc (the “original falcon fund”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by the original falcon fund. in december 2021, we agreed to commit an additional $50.0 million to a newly formed entity, crowdstrike falcon fund ii llc (“falcon fund ii”) in exchange for 50% of the sharing percentage of any distribution by falcon fund ii. further, entities associated with accel also agreed to commit up to $10.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to the original falcon fund and falcon fund ii (collectively, the “falcon funds”), and collectively own the remaining 50% of the sharing percentage of the falcon funds. both falcon funds are in the business of purchasing, selling, and investing in minority equity and convertible debt securities of privately-held companies that develop applications that have potential for substantial contribution to us and our platform. we are the manager of the falcon funds and control their investment decisions and day-to-day operations and accordingly have consolidated each of the falcon funds. each falcon fund has a duration of ten years and may be extended for three additional years. at dissolution, the falcon funds will be liquidated, and the remaining assets will be distributed to the investors based on their respective sharing percentage. contractual obligations and commitments our commitments consist of obligations under non-cancellable real estate arrangements on an undiscounted basis, of which $15.3 million is due in the next 12 months and $41.0 million is due thereafter. in addition, we have debt obligations related to $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due in fiscal 2030 and the interest payments associated with the senior notes of $22.5 million due in the next 12 months and $101.3 million due thereafter. we have non-cancellable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase products and services entered in the normal course of business totaling $747.6 million as of january 31, 2024, with remaining terms in excess of 12 months. we expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operations and cash on our balance sheet."
CRWD,"subsequent to january 31, 2024, we have committed to an additional $1.8 billion of non-cancellable purchase obligations from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2031. on march 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire flow security ltd., a privately held company. the purchase price for the transaction will be approximately $115.0 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2025."
CRWD,"as of january 31, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits included $12.7 million, which were classified as long-term liabilities due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits. critical accounting policies and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. see note 1, description of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10-k. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of factors affecting our business, and our belief as to what could occur in the future considering available information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the accounting estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained, and our operating environment changes. changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and, if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. by their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these estimates."
CRWD,"the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below."
CRWD,"revenue recognition we derive our revenue predominately from subscription revenue, which is primarily based on the solutions subscribed to by the customer. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. our professional services are available through time and material and fixed fee agreements. revenue from professional services is recognized as services are performed. we enter into revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations in which a customer may purchase combinations of subscriptions, support, training, and consulting service. judgment is required when considering the terms and conditions of these contracts. the transaction price for these contracts is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“ssp”) basis. the ssp is the price at which we would sell promised subscription or professional services separately to a customer. business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangibles assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected customer attrition rates, estimated obsolescence rates, and discount rates. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. we account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we establish a liability for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service (“irs”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, description of business and significant accounting policies, included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information about the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements."
ZS,"our provision for income taxes increased by $8.7 million, or 44%, for fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023. the change was primarily driven by the increase in our pre-tax income in both foreign and u.s. jurisdictions in which we conduct business, offset by the reduction of the valuation allowance due to the establishment of deferred tax liabilities from the business acquisition. for further information, refer to note 15, income taxes, of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our effective tax rate of (97.4)% and (10.9)% in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, differs from the applicable u.s. statutory federal income tax rate due to our valuation allowance against our u.s. federal, state, and u.k. deferred tax assets as well as our foreign income being taxed at different rates than the u.s. statutory rate. comparison of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 for a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended july 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended july 31, 2022, refer to part ii, item 7, management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, of our annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec on september 14, 2023."
ZS,"liquidity and capital resources as of july 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $2,409.7 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. our cash equivalents and investments consist of highly liquid investments in money market funds, u.s. treasury securities, u.s. government agency securities, certificates of deposit and corporate debt securities. in june 2020, we completed the private offering of the notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1,150.0 million. the total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchase discount and issuance costs, was $1,130.5 million. in connection with the notes, we entered into the capped call transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes. we used an aggregate amount of $145.2 million of the net proceeds of the notes to purchase the capped calls. we have generated significant losses from operations, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1,148.1 million as of july 31, 2024. we expect to continue to incur operating losses and have in the past and may in the future generate negative cash flows due to expected investments to grow our business, including potential business acquisitions and other strategic transactions. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditure, and convertible senior notes repayment requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements. our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures to support expansion of our infrastructure and workforce, lease obligations, purchase commitments, potential business acquisitions, convertible senior notes repayment requirements and other strategic transactions. our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. our actual results could vary as a result of, and our future capital requirements, both near-term and long-term, will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operating activities, the timing of new introductions of solutions or features, and the continuing market acceptance of our services, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation and recessionary environments, and the impact of global crises to our and our customers', vendors' and partners' businesses. we have and may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. additionally, some of the factors that may influence our operations are not within our control, such as general economic conditions, geopolitical developments and the impact of global crises. we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. we typically invoice our customers annually in advance, and to a lesser extent quarterly in advance, monthly in advance or multi-year in advance. therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as a contract liability. deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. as of july 31, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $1,895.0 million, of which $1,643.9 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. subscriptions that are invoiced annually in advance or multi-year in advance contribute significantly to our short-term and long-term deferred revenue in comparison to our invoices issued quarterly in advance or monthly in advance. accordingly, we cannot predict the mix of invoicing schedules in any given period. as of july 31, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes."

ZS,"1) identify the contract with a customer we consider the terms and conditions of the contracts and our customary business practices in identifying our contracts under asc 606. we determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, we can identify each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred, we can identify the payment terms for the services, we have determined the customer to have the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. we apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. our performance obligations consist of (i) our subscription and support services and (ii) professional and other services. 3) determine the transaction price the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. none of our contracts contain a significant financing component. 4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract if the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or ssp. 5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised service to a customer. revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. we generate all our revenue from contracts with customers and apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition."
ZS,"subscription and support revenue we generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to access our cloud platform, together with related support services to our customers. arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of our software operating our cloud platform at any time. instead, customers are granted continuous access to our cloud platform over the contractual period. a time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because we transfer control evenly over the contractual period. accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription and support revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. the typical subscription and support term is one to three years. most of our contracts are non-cancelable over the contractual term. customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. some of our customers have the option to purchase additional subscription and support services at a stated price. these options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at our ssp. professional and other services revenue professional and other services revenue consists of fees associated with providing deployment advisory services that educate and assist our customers on the best use of our solutions, as well as advise customers on best practices as they deploy our solution. these services are distinct from subscription and support services. professional services do not result in significant customization of the subscription service. revenue from professional services provided on a time and materials basis is recognized as the services are performed. total professional and other services revenue has historically been insignificant. contracts with multiple performance obligations most of our contracts with customers contain multiple promised services consisting of (i) our subscription and support services and (ii) professional and other services that are distinct and accounted for separately. the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis. we determine ssp based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription and support services and professional and other services, the geographical region of the customer and the number of users. variable consideration revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. the amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. if our services do not meet certain service level commitments, our customers are entitled to receive service credits, and in certain cases, refunds, each representing a form of variable consideration. we have not historically experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by our subscription contracts. accordingly, any estimated refunds related to these agreements in the consolidated financial statements were not material during the periods presented. we provide rebates and other credits within our contracts with certain customers which are estimated based on the most likely amounts expected to be earned or claimed on the related sales transaction. overall, the transaction price is reduced to reflect our estimate of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. estimated rebates and other credits were not material during the periods presented. contract balances contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract. such amounts are recognized as revenue over the contractual period. we receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules; accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30 days. contract assets include amounts related to our contractual right to consideration for both completed and partially completed performance obligations that may not have been invoiced and such amounts have been insignificant to date."
ZS,"costs to obtain and fulfill a contract we capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to sales personnel that are incremental to the acquisition of channel partner and direct customer contracts. these costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on the consolidated balance sheets. we determine whether costs should be deferred based on our sales compensation plans, if the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. sales commissions for renewal of a contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract given the substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years while commissions paid for renewal contracts are amortized over the contractual term of the renewals. amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. we determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract by taking into consideration the expected subscription term and expected renewals of our customer contracts, the duration of our relationships with customers, customer retention data, our technology development life cycle and other factors. management exercises judgment to determine the period of benefit to amortize contract acquisition costs by considering factors such as expected renewals of customer contracts, duration of customer relationships and our technology development life cycle. although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. we periodically review these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred contract acquisition costs."

NET,"key elements of our business model include: significant investment in ongoing product development. we invest significantly in research and development. our focus on research and development allows us to continually enhance the capabilities and functionality of our global network with new products and product features that are innovative and powerful and can be quickly adopted by our customers and helps us grow our customer base, which allows us to serve a greater portion of the world's internet traffic. that in turn provides us with greater knowledge and insight into the challenges that internet users face every day. investments in our network for growth. we believe that the size, sophistication, and distributed nature of our network provide us with a significant competitive advantage. we intend to continue to make substantial investments in network infrastructure to support the growth of our business. as we invest in our network, we believe the service that we can provide our customers and the insight and knowledge that we can gain will continue to grow. efficient go-to-market model. we have built an efficient go-to market model that reflects the flexibility and ease of use our products offer to our customers around the world. this has enabled us to acquire new customers as well as to expand within our existing customer base in a rapid, cost-effective manner. in particular, we have invested heavily in our contracted customer sales efforts. ◦new customer acquisition. we believe that anyone that relies on the internet to deliver products, services, or content or to operate its business can be a cloudflare customer. as such, we are focused on driving an increased number of customers onto our network and products to support our long-term growth. we continue to invest to build our direct sales force, increase brand awareness, leverage and expand channel partners, and improve the sophistication of our sales operations for contracted customers, particularly large customers. additionally, through our pay-as-you-go offering, a customer can subscribe to one of our many plans and begin using our network quickly, with minimal technical skill and no professional services. this has allowed us to acquire a large portion of our paying customers very rapidly and at significantly lower customer acquisition costs than our other product offerings. ◦expansion of our existing customers. we believe that our network enables a large opportunity for growth within our existing customer base given the breadth of products we offer on our infrastructure platform. our relationships with customers often start with servicing a portion of their overall needs and expand over time as they realize the significant value we deliver. once a customer has adopted one product on our network, it can easily add additional products. as we add more products and functionality to our network, we see opportunities to drive upsell as customers seek to consolidate onto one infrastructure platform to meet all of their security, performance, and reliability network requirements. we also intend to continue to invest in market awareness of our new products to improve growth within our existing customers. ◦international reach. our global network, with a presence in more than 310 cities and over 120 countries worldwide, has helped to foster our strong international growth. international markets represented 48%, 47% and 48% of our revenue in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and we intend to continue to invest in our international growth as a strategy to expand our customer base around the world. free customer base. free customers are an important part of our business. these customers are typically individual developers, early-stage startups, hobbyists, and other users and, like our pay-as-you-go customers, sign up for our service through our website. our free customers create scale, serve as efficient brand marketing, and help us attract developers, customers, and potential employees. these free customers expose us to diverse traffic, threats, and problems, often allowing us to see potential security, performance, and reliability issues at the earliest stage. this knowledge allows us to improve our products and deliver more effective solutions to our paying customers. in addition, the added scale and diversity of this traffic makes us valuable to a diverse set of global isps, improving the breadth and economic terms of our interconnections, bandwidth costs, and co-location expenses. finally, the enthusiastic engagement of our free customer base represents a ""virtual quality assurance"" function that allows us to maintain a high rate of product innovation, while ensuring our products are extensively tested in real world environments before they are deployed to our paying customers."
NET,"opportunities, challenges, and risks we believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including growing our paying customer base, particularly large customers, expanding our relationships with existing paying customers, developing and successfully launching new products and features, expanding into additional market segments, expanding our base of free customers, and developing and maintaining favorable peering and co-location relationships. each of these factors presents significant opportunities for us, but also poses material challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to grow our business and improve our operating results. we expect that addressing these challenges and risks will increase our operating expenses significantly over the next several years. the timing of our future profitability, if we achieve profitability at all, will depend upon many variables, including the success of our growth strategies and the timing and size of investments and expenditures that we choose to undertake, as well as market growth and other factors that are not within our control. in addition, we must comply with complex, uncertain, and evolving laws, rules, and regulatory requirements across federal, state, and international jurisdictions. if we fail to successfully address these challenges, risks, and variables, our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. impact of macroeconomic developments we are closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and global events, such as the hamas-israel and the russia-ukraine conflicts and the potential expansion of those conflicts and other areas of geopolitical tension around the world, and how they may adversely impact our and our customers’ businesses. weak economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets related to stock market volatility, inflation, recession, changes in tariffs, trade agreements or governmental fiscal, monetary and tax policies, among others, could adversely impact our and our customers’ business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, general tightening in the credit market, lower levels of liquidity, increases in rates of default and bankruptcy, and significant volatility in equity and fixed-income markets could all negatively impact our customers’ purchasing decisions. starting in the first half of 2022, potentially as a result of these various macroeconomic impacts on our customers, we periodically have experienced lengthening of the average sales cycle for certain types of customers and sales (including sales to new customers and expansion sales to existing customers), slowdowns in our pipeline of potential new customers and in the rate of converting sales pipeline opportunities into new sales, increase in average days sales outstanding, higher levels of churn in our paying customer base (which is when any of our paying customers cease to be a paying customer for any reason, including any pay-as-you-go customer converting to a free subscription plan), and lengthening of the timing of payment from some of our customers, all of which may have contributed to a slowdown in our revenue growth over that period (including with respect to new customers). we believe macroeconomic uncertainty could persist through 2024. as a result, we expect that some or all of the negative trends described in this paragraph may emerge or recur during future quarters. to the extent challenging macroeconomic conditions persist, we may experience additional adverse effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. these effects could include, among others, reduction or increased delays in purchasing decisions by existing and potential new paying customers, additional lengthening of the sales cycle for some of our existing and potential new paying customers, potential customer requests for concessions (including in terms of payment amounts and/or timing and earlier or additional termination rights), potential losses of paying customers as a result of economic distress or bankruptcy (particularly among our small and medium paying customer base), potential reductions in new non-u.s. customers and expansion of sales to existing non-u.s. paying customers as a result of our products, which are substantially all sold in u.s. dollars, becoming relatively more expensive for such customers due to the higher value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, and increased costs for employee compensation and equipment purchases resulting from continued inflationary cost pressures. for further discussion of the challenges and risks we confront related to macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tension around the world, please refer to part i, item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10-k.

NET,"key business metrics in addition to our results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and the non-gaap measures discussed above, we also review the key business metrics discussed below to assist us in evaluating our business, measuring performance, identifying trends, formulating business plans, and making strategic decisions. there are a number of limitations associated with the use of key business metrics as analytical tools, however, and we do not rely upon any single key business metric to evaluate our business. in addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled business metrics differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these business metrics as tools for comparison to such companies. paying customers we believe our ability to grow the number of paying customers on our network provides a key indicator of growth of our business and our future business opportunities. we define a paying customer at the end of the quarter as a person or entity who has generated revenue and has an active contract with us or one of our partners during such quarter, excluding (i) customers that were not acquired through ordinary sales channels, (ii) customers using only our registrar product, and (iii) customers using our consumer applications, such as 1.1.1.1 and warp, which agreements and customers together represent an insignificant amount of our revenue. an entity is defined as a company, a government institution, a non-profit organization, or a distinct business unit of a large company. an active contract is defined as a customer relationship for which we have provided services during the quarter. the number of paying customers was 189,791, 162,086, and 140,096 as of december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. paying customers (> $100,000 annualized revenue) while we continue to grow customers across all sizes, over time, our large customers have contributed an increasing share of our revenue. we view the number of customers with annualized revenue greater than $100,000 as indicative of our penetration within large enterprise accounts. to measure annualized revenue at the end of a quarter, we take the sum of revenue for each customer in the quarter and multiply that amount by four. for example, if we signed a new customer that generated $1,800 of revenue in a quarter, that customer would account for $7,200 of annualized revenue for that year. our annualized revenue calculation excludes (i) agreements that were not entered into through ordinary sales channels, (ii) revenue generated from customers using only our registrar product, and (iii) customers using our consumer applications, such as 1.1.1.1 and warp, which agreements and customers together represent an insignificant amount of our revenue. our annualized revenue metric also includes any usage charges by a customer during a period, which represents a small portion of our total revenue and may not be recurring. as a result, annualized revenue may be higher than actual revenue over the"

NET,"dollar-based net retention rate our ability to maintain long-term revenue growth and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to retain and grow revenue generated from our existing paying customers. we believe that we will achieve these objectives by continuing to focus on customer loyalty and adding additional products and functionality to our network. our dollar-based net retention rate is a key way we measure our performance in these areas. dollar-based net retention measures our ability to retain and expand recurring revenue from existing customers. to calculate dollar-based net retention for a quarter, we compare the annualized revenue from paying customers four quarters prior to the annualized revenue from the same set of customers in the most recent quarter. our dollar-based net retention includes expansion and is net of contraction and attrition, but excludes annualized revenue from new customers in the current period. our dollar-based net retention excludes the benefit of free customers that upgrade to a paid subscription between the prior and current periods, even though this is an important source of incremental growth. we believe this provides a more meaningful representation of our ability to add incremental business from existing paying customers as they renew and expand their contracts. our dollar-based net retention rates for the three months ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were 115%, 122%, and 125%, respectively. components of our results of operations"
NET,"revenue we generate revenue primarily from sales to our customers of subscriptions to access our network and products, together with related support services. arrangements with customers generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession at any time of our software operating our global network. instead, customers are granted continuous access to our network and products over the contractual period. a time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because we transfer control evenly over the contractual period. accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription and support revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. usage-based consideration is primarily related to fees charged for our customer’s use of excess bandwidth when accessing our network in a given period and is recognized as revenue in the period in which the usage occurs. the typical subscription and support term for our contracted customers is one year and subscription and support term lengths range from one to three years. most of our contracts with contracted customers are non-cancelable over the contractual term. customers may have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. for our pay-as-you-go customers, subscription and support term contracts are typically monthly. cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses that are directly related to providing our service to our paying customers. these expenses include expenses related to operating in co-location facilities, network and bandwidth costs, depreciation of our equipment located in co-location facilities, certificate authority services costs for paying customers, related overhead costs, the amortization of our capitalized internal-use software, and the amortization of acquired developed technologies. cost of revenue also includes employee-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our paying customers. other costs included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions and allocated overhead costs. as our customers expand and increase the use of our global network and products driven by additional applications and connected devices, we expect that our cost of revenue will increase due to higher network and bandwidth costs and expenses related to operating in additional co-location facilities. however, we expect to continue to benefit from economies of scale as our customers increase the use of our global network and products. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our global network and products and our customer support organizations as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. gross profit and gross margin gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. our gross profit and gross margin have and are expected to continue to fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of acquisition of new customers and our renewals with existing customers, expenses related to operating in co-location facilities and network and bandwidth costs to operate and expand our global network, and amortization of costs associated with capitalized internal-use software. we expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars and our gross margin to remain consistent over the long term, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of all of these factors. operating expenses"
NET,"sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions that are recognized as expenses over the period of benefit, marketing programs, certificate authority services costs for free customers, travel-related expenses, bandwidth and co-location costs for free customers, and allocated overhead costs. sales commissions earned by our sales force and the associated payroll taxes that are direct and incremental to the acquisition of channel partner and direct customer contracts are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of three years for the initial acquisition of a contract and over the contractual term of the renewals for renewal contracts. we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase our brand awareness, including marketing efforts to continue to drive our pay-as-you-go business model. as a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. however, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. research and development research and development costs consist primarily of employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. research and development costs support our efforts to add new features to our existing offerings and to ensure the security, performance, and reliability of our global network. we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our global network and products. we expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative personnel, professional fees for external legal services, accounting, and other consulting services, bad debt expense, and allocated overhead costs. we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth as well as due to additional costs associated with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs as a result of operating as a public company. however, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. non-operating income (expense)"

2025 notes to exchange approximately $400 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 notes for an aggregate of $400.7 million in cash (including accrued interest) and approximately 7.6 million shares of our class a common stock. during the three months ended june 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately $123.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 notes for $172.7 million in cash

assessments of the period of time through which our existing financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and our expected sources of capital for the future operation of our business after such period of time are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could vary as a result of, and our near- and long-term future capital requirements will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support our infrastructure and research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new introductions of products or features, the continuing market adoption of our global network and products, and the impact of macroeconomic

we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. additionally, some of the factors that may influence our operations are not within our control, such as general economic conditions. we may seek, or be required to seek, additional equity or debt financing from time to time in the future. in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. as of december 31, 2023, our material cash requirements include contractual obligations from the 2026 notes, purchase commitments and lease obligations. refer to notes 6, 7, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information regarding these material cash requirements. in addition to the contractual obligations described above, as of december 31, 2023, we had $4.4 million recognized as total restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets which mainly related to irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees that are required under lease agreements and indemnity holdback consideration associated with asset acquisitions. cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:"
NET,"year ended december 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in thousands) net cash provided by operating activities $254,406 $123,595 $64,648 net cash used in investing activities $(186,201) $(235,696) $(709,322) net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $(192,185) $6,347 $847,486"
NET,"operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2023 was $254.4 million, which resulted from a net loss of $183.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $543.1 million and net cash outflow of $104.7 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash charges primarily consisted of $274.0 million for stock-based compensation expense, $135.8 million for depreciation and amortization expense, $61.4 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $50.3 million for loss on extinguishment of debt, $44.8 million for non-cash operating lease costs, $13.6 million for provision for bad debt, and $4.5 million for amortization of convertible note issuance costs, which were partially offset by $44.4 million for net accretion of discounts. the net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $113.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net, which increased due to our growing customer base and timing of collections from our customers, a $101.5 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs due to increased sales commissions from the addition of new customers, a $40.0 million increase in payments for operating lease liabilities, a $22.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to operating activities, which were partially offset by a $134.5 million increase in deferred revenue, a $25.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to operating activities, and a $11.8 million increase in accounts payable related to operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2022 was $123.6 million, which resulted from a net loss of $193.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $396.3 million and net cash outflow of $79.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash charges primarily consisted of $202.8 million for stock-based compensation expense, $102.3 million for depreciation and amortization expense, $45.1 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, $36.3 million for non-cash operating lease costs, $4.8 million for provision for bad debt, and $4.7 million for amortization of convertible note issuance costs. the net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $67.9 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs due to increased sales commissions from the addition of new customers, a $56.2 million increase in accounts receivable, net, which increased due to our growing customer base and timing of collections from our customers, a $31.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $9.6 million decrease in accounts payable related to operating activities, a $7.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to operating activities, a $5.4 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to operating activities, and a $2.2 million increase in contract assets, which were partially offset by a $102.2 million increase in deferred revenue. investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2023 of $186.2 million resulted primarily from the purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1,877.5 million, capital expenditures of $114.4 million, capitalization of internal-use software development costs of $20.5 million, and cash paid for asset acquisitions of $6.1 million. these activities were partially offset by the maturities of available-for-sale securities of $1,812.0 million and the sales of available-for-sale securities of $20.2 million. net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2022 of $235.7 million resulted primarily from the purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1,133.0 million, capital expenditures of $143.6 million, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $88.2 million, and capitalization of internal-use software development costs of $19.8 million. these activities were partially offset by the maturities of available-for-sale securities of $1,148.8 million. financing activities net cash used in financing activities of $192.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily due to $207.6 million of repayments of the 2025 notes, $10.5 million of payments of indemnity holdback, and $8.0 million payment of tax withholding on restricted stock unit (rsu) settlements, which were partially offset by $19.1 million proceeds from the issuance of class a common stock pursuant to the 2019 employee stock purchase plan (espp) and $14.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of vested and unvested stock options. net cash provided by financing activities of $6.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to $15.3 million proceeds from the issuance of class a common stock pursuant to the espp and $10.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of vested and unvested stock options, which were partially offset by $16.6 million of repayments of the 2025 notes, and $2.5 million payment of tax withholding on rsu settlements. off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred contract acquisitions costs, the period of benefit generated from the deferred contract acquisition costs, the capitalization and estimated useful life of internal-use software, valuation of acquired intangible assets, the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, useful lives of property and equipment, the determination of the incremental borrowing rate used for operating lease liabilities, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation awards, uncertain tax positions, and the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. none of these estimates are critical accounting estimates for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. due in part to the hamas-israel and russia-ukraine conflicts, and other geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, there is ongoing uncertainty and significant disruption in the global economy and financial markets. we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of assets or liabilities as of february 21, 2024, the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10-k. these estimates and assumptions may change in the future, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. our actual results could differ from these estimates. change in accounting estimate in january 2024, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers-network infrastructure, resulting in a change in the estimated useful lives of our servers-network infrastructure from four years to five years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $20 million for the fiscal year 2024 for assets in service as of december 31, 2023, recorded primarily in cost of revenue. see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information relating to the useful lives of our servers-network infrastructure. recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements. recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective in november 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-07, segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures, which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. the asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures, which requires an entity, on an annual basis, to disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. the amendment in the asu is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of

AMD,"item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022 and for each of the three years in the period ended december 30, 2023 and related notes, which are included in this annual report on form 10-k as well as with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, “part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data.” introduction in this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of advanced micro devices, inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “amd”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022. overview during 2023 we successfully launched multiple leadership products across our business and made important progress on our artificial intelligence (ai) strategy. in data center, we launched several 4th gen amd epyc™ processors, including our amd epyc 97x4 processors, formerly codenamed “bergamo,” built with our “zen 4c” architecture core and designed to deliver leadership cloud-native computing, and our amd epyc 8004 series processors, formerly codenamed “siena”, that bring the “zen 4c” core into a purpose-built cpu. in addition, we announced the extension of our 3rd gen amd epyc processor family with six new offerings to meet the needs of general it and mainstream computing for businesses seeking to leverage the economics of established platforms. for our ai data center solutions, we announced the availability of the amd instinct™ mi300x accelerators that are designed to deliver leadership performance for generative ai workloads and high performance computing (hpc) applications. in addition, we unveiled the amd instinct mi300a apu, which integrate the cpu and gpu cores on a single package delivering an efficient platform while also providing the compute performance to accelerate training on the latest ai models. we enhanced the performance and features of our amd rocm™ software by releasing our latest amd rocm 6 open software platform for ai and hpc workloads. we expanded our embedded processor portfolio with powerful, scalable offerings for a variety of embedded applications such as the amd ryzen™ embedded 7000 series processor family. we launched the amd versal™ premium vp1902 adaptive soc designed to help chipmakers streamline the verification of application-specific integrated circuits (sics) and soc designs, and we introduced the spartan™ ultrascale+™ fpga ideal for cost-sensitive applications requiring low power and high i/o. we launched the amd alveo™ ma35d media accelerator to power live interactive streaming services at scale, as well as the amd alveo ul3524 accelerator card. we expanded our zynq™ ultrascale™ rfsoc digital front-end portfolio with two additional devices to enable the expansion and deployment of 4g/5g radios where lower cost, power and spectrum-efficient radios are required to address increased wireless connectivity. for our adaptive system-on-modules (soms), we announced the addition of amd kria™ k24 som and kd240 drives starter kit which offer power-efficient compute in a small factor and target cost-sensitive industrial and commercial edge applications. we continued to expand our client product portfolio by launching our ryzen 7000 series mobile processors bringing the power of “zen 4” and amd rdna 3 integrated graphics architecture to notebook users. we expanded our commercial portfolio with amd ryzen pro 7000 series mobile processors to bring advanced and power efficient x86 processors to business notebooks and mobile workstations. we announced our ryzen 7045hx3d gaming mobile processor with amd 3d v-cache technology with leadership mobile gaming performance. we also introduced amd ryzen x3d desktop processors, the ryzen 9 7900x3d and ryzen 9 7950x3d processors with 3d v-cache technology. for handheld pc gaming consoles, we introduced the amd ryzen z1 and z1 extreme processors featuring rdna 3 architecture based graphics, to bring portability and battery life to handled pc gaming consoles. in gaming, we introduced the amd radeon rx 7900m graphics for laptops, delivering desktop-class performance for gaming and content creation. we also introduced the new amd radeon™ pro w7000 series graphics, our first professional graphic cards built on advanced amd chiplet design to deliver leadership performance and unique features: the amd radeon pro w7600 and amd radeon pro w7500. we designed these workstation graphics cards for mainstream professional workflows. we also unveiled the amd radeon rx 7800 xt and radeon rx 7700 xt graphics cards optimized to deliver high-performance and high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences along with amd fidelityfx™ super resolution 3 designed to offer performance boosts in supported games. we expanded our ai engagements with a broad set of data center customers during the year. in our data center gpu business, demand for our data center gpus products was very strong as we had large hyperscaler customers committed to deploy our next generation amd instinct mi300 accelerators. our ai strategy is focused on three areas: first, to deliver a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership cpus, gpus and adaptive computing solutions for ai inference and training; second, to extend the open software platform we have established to enable our ai hardware to be deployed broadly and with ease; and third, expand the deep and collaborative engagements we have established across the ecosystems to accelerate deployments of amd-based ai solutions at scale. to help execute our ai strategy and accelerate our ai business, we brought together multiple ai teams across amd to execute our end-to-end ai hardware strategy and drive development of a comprehensive software ecosystem that will span our full product portfolio. we strengthened our ai software capabilities with strategic acquisitions during the year. in august 2023, we acquired mipsology sas, an ai software company to help develop the full amd ai software stack and expand the open ecosystem of software tools, libraries and models. we further expanded our open ai software capabilities with the acquisition of nod, inc., an open ai software company, in october 2023. nod, inc.’s software technology helps accelerate the deployment of ai solutions optimized for amd instinct data center accelerators, ryzen ai processors, epyc processors, versal socs and radeon gpus. against the backdrop of a mixed demand environment, net revenue for 2023 was $22.7 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to 2022 net revenue of $23.6 billion. the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a 25% decrease in client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor sales and a 9% decrease in gaming segment revenue primarily due to lower semi-custom product sales. this decrease was partially offset by a 17% increase in embedded segment revenue primarily due to the inclusion of embedded product revenue from xilinx, inc. (xilinx) for the full twelve months period in 2023, as compared to a partial period from february 14, 2022 (the xilinx acquisition date) in the prior year period, and a 7% increase in data center segment revenue primarily driven by higher sales of amd instinct gpus and 4th gen amd epyc cpus. gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2023, was 46%, compared to 45% in 2022. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by lower client segment revenue and product mix. operating income for 2023 was $401 million compared to operating income of $1.3 billion for 2022. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower client segment performance and increased r&d investments, partially offset by lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. net income for 2023 was $854 million compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. the decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of december 30, 2023 were $5.8 billion, compared to $5.9 billion at the end of 2022. our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion. during the twelve months ended december 30, 2023, we returned a total of $985 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 9.7 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. as of december 30, 2023, $5.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. the repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. revenue allowances. revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under asc 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. we determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (oem) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers. we base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to oem and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both. our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis. our estimates of necessary adjustments for oem price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future oem rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis. we offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. for transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. we also provide limited product return rights to certain oems and to most distribution customers. these return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. in order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and oem customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable. overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with oem and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. inventory valuation. we value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. in determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. in determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. if in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. if in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. goodwill. goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. our reporting units are at the operating segment level. our goodwill is contained within four reporting units: data center, client, gaming and embedded. we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. based on our annual qualitative impairment test, we concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. long-lived and intangible assets. long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. when indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. income taxes. in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. we regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. when considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. in determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. through the end of 2023, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. the federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under internal revenue code section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities. results of operations additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 4 – segment reporting of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). our operating results tend to vary seasonally. historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends."

AMD,"data center data center net revenue of $6.5 billion in 2023 increased by 7%, compared to net revenue of $6.0 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily driven by higher sales of amd instinct gpus and 4th gen amd epyc cpus. data center operating income was $1.3 billion in 2023, compared to operating income of $1.8 billion in 2022. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to product mix and higher research and development (r&d) investment. client client net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2023 decreased by 25%, compared to net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022, primarily due to lower sales of ryzen mobile and desktop processors, resulting from a 16% decrease in average selling price and a 12% decrease in unit shipments. lower ryzen processor sales were due to weak pc market conditions and inventory correction across the pc supply chain that impacted the first half of 2023."
AMD,"client operating loss was $46 million in 2023, compared to operating income of $1.2 billion in 2022. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue."
AMD,"gaming gaming net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2023 decreased by 9%, compared to net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022. the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue. gaming operating income was $971 million in 2023, compared to operating income of $953 million in 2022. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by product mix, partially offset by higher r&d investment. embedded embedded net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023 increased by 17%, compared to net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022. the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of embedded product revenue from xilinx, inc.

AMD,"research and development expenses research and development expenses of $5.9 billion in 2023 increased by $867 million, or 17%, compared to $5.0 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount to support increased investment in ai. marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.4 billion in 2023 increased by $16 million, or 1%, compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs."
AMD,"amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.8 billion for 2023 decreased by $737 million, or 21%, compared to $3.5 billion in 2022. the decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the first half of the current fiscal year."

NVDA,"recent developments, future objectives and challenges"
NVDA,"demand and supply, product transitions, and new products and business models demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. we have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. we may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. supply of hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. we expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. we build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. while we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. these risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our data center, professional visualization, and gaming products. we will have a broader and faster data center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of ai opportunities. the increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. while we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. we build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our nvidia dgx cloud services, omniverse platform, llms, and generative ai models. our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. recent technologies, such as generative ai models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for data center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. global trade during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the usg, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to china (including hong kong and macau) and russia of our a100 and h100 integrated circuits, dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuits. in july 2023, the usg informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the middle east. in october 2023, the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to china and country groups d1, d4, and d5 (including but not limited to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, and vietnam, but excluding israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including a100, a800, h100, h800, l4, l40, l40s and rtx 4090. the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, country group d5, including china. on october 23, 2023, the usg informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100, a800, h100, h800, and l40s products. our sales to china decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to china. we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the usg does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. we have started to ship alternatives to the china market in small volumes. china represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to usg licensing requirements and we expect china to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. to the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the usg will grant such a license, or that the usg will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the usg’s export controls. given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions, the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. in the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market, as well as other impacted markets, including the middle east. while we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the asia-pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. refer to “item 1a. risk factors – risks related to regulatory, legal, our stock and other matters” for a discussion of this potential impact. macroeconomic factors macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. while difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. israel and hamas conflict we are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. we believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in israel. accordingly, some of our employees in israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business. fiscal year 2024 summary"

NVDA,"critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of significant accounting policies. inventories we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment. situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. the net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. we account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. we also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products."
NVDA,refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management's discussion and analysis for further discussion.
NVDA,"income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential u.s. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. as of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. revenue recognition"
NVDA,"revenue allowances for products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. however, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. for shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. we account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. license and development arrangements revenue from license and development arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. contracts with multiple performance obligations our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. except for license and development arrangements, nvidia products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. we allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. in certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. if standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. change in accounting estimate in february 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. the estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. results of operations a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2023, filed with the sec on february 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com."

NVDA,"compute & networking revenue – the year-on-year increase was due to higher data center revenue. compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the nvidia hopper gpu computing platform for the training and inference of llms, recommendation engines and generative ai applications. networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of infiniband. graphics revenue – the year-on-year increase was led by growth in gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. reportable segment operating income – the year-on-year increase in compute & networking and graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. all other operating loss - the year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024."
NVDA,"concentration of revenue revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively."
NVDA,"our direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, oems, odms, system integrators, aib, and distributors. sales to one customer, customer a, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the compute & networking segment. one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through customer a, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the compute & networking segment. our estimated compute & networking demand is expected to remain concentrated. there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022."
NVDA,"gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, ip-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations. our overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. the year over year increase was primarily due to strong data center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue. provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. the net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. operating expenses"

applications that span cloud, edge and everything in between. enterprises rely on couchbase to cost-effectively power the core applications their businesses depend on with the highest performance, reliability, scalability and versatility requirements for which there is no tolerance for disruption or downtime. any compromise of these requirements could cause these applications to fail—stopping or delaying package delivery for shipping companies, interrupting reservations for travel companies or causing product shortages in stores for retailers. our database is versatile and works in multiple configurations, from fully-managed cloud to multi- or hybrid-cloud, to on-premises environments, and beyond the edge. we have architected our database to fuse the trusted strengths of relational databases with the flexibility, performance and scale of many nosql systems, across the cloud. our database platform serves the needs of both enterprise architects and application developers. combined with our performance at scale, we believe this power enables customers to run their most important applications with the effectiveness they require, with the efficiency they desire and in the modern infrastructure environments they demand. with nearly every aspect of our lives being transformed by digital innovation, enterprises are charged with building applications that enable delightful and meaningful customer experiences. enterprises are increasingly reliant on applications, which in turn rely on databases to store, retrieve and operationalize data into action. today, applications are operating at a scale, speed and dynamism unheard of just a decade ago. there is an increasing diversity of application types, modalities and delivery and consumption models, and the volume, velocity and variety of data on which they rely is growing at an exponential rate. looking forward, there is potential for ai to drastically transform business and the nature of modern applications as a whole. consequently, the demand on enterprises and their databases is growing exponentially. while legacy database technologies were built to the highest performance and reliability requirements of their generation, they are approaching the limits for which they were designed. the underlying architecture of these technologies has not changed significantly, while the requirements of the applications they need to support are changing dramatically, especially with the emergence of generative ai which relies heavily on real-time data. legacy database technologies are buckling under the pressure of digital transformation, as they were not built to update and respond in microseconds, enable rich, customized user experiences and perform without latency. we designed couchbase to give enterprises a database for the modern cloud world. our platform combines the best capabilities of a relational database, like sql transactions and acid guarantees, with the flexibility and scalability of a nosql database. this allows enterprises to confidently accelerate strategic initiatives such as more quickly moving business-critical applications into the cloud, improving application flexibility and increasing developer agility. for our customers, we facilitate a seamless transition from legacy relational databases to our modern cloud database platform resulting in better application scalability, user experience and security at the pace that works for them. we believe our unique architecture is also well-suited to power ai applications which require exceptionally high performance and scalability. we deliver this cloud database platform both as a customer-managed product and as a fully-managed database-as-a-service that is managed by couchbase. our database-as-a-service, called couchbase capella, supports a broad set of use cases, reducing a customer’s need to buy, deploy and manage additional databases or supporting technologies. we sell our platform through our direct sales force and our ecosystem of partners. our platform is broadly accessible to a wide range of enterprises, as well as governments and organizations. we have customers in a range of industries, including retail and e-commerce, travel and hospitality, financial services and insurance, software and technology, gaming, media and entertainment and industrials. we focus our selling efforts on the largest global enterprises with the most"
BASE,"complex data requirements, and we have cloud-based, fully managed offerings for enterprises looking for a turnkey version of our platform. we have achieved significant growth over our operating history. for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, our revenue was $180.0 million, $154.8 million and $123.5 million, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rates of 16% and 25%, respectively. as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, our annual recurring revenue (“arr”) was $204.2 million and $163.7 million, respectively, representing period-over-period growth of 25%. for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, our net loss was $80.2 million, $68.5 million and $58.2 million, respectively, as we continued to invest in the growth of our business to capture the massive opportunity that we believe is available to us."
BASE,"our business model we generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, which accounted for 95%, 92% and 94% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. we derive a substantial majority of our subscription revenue from the enterprise edition of couchbase server and couchbase mobile. couchbase server is generally licensed per node, which we define as an instance of couchbase running on a server. our subscription pricing is based on the computing power and memory per instance, as well as the chosen service level. we offer three different support levels: the platinum level offers 24/7 support and the shortest response time of 30 minutes; the gold level offers 24/7 support with a response time of 2 hours; and the silver level offers 7am-5pm local time support, 5 days a week. these response times are for incidents of the highest severity level, which we identify as level p1. the initial response time for levels p2 and p3 incidents, which are less severe, are longer. we also derive subscription revenue from our database-as-a-service offering. our database-as-a-service offering, called couchbase capella, is sold on a consumption basis, which removes the need to license different node types separately. couchbase capella pricing delivers superior customer flexibility relative to other cloud service providers (“csps”) as on-demand pricing allows customers to pay only for what they use based on hourly pricing and the credits purchased through our annual credit model expire only at the end of a 12-month period, rather than ratably throughout the year. we also provide automatic conversion to on-demand consumption when annual credits expire or are exhausted. couchbase capella credits can be purchased upfront to provide cost savings with volume discounts available based on credit quantity. we offer three pricing levels for couchbase capella, based on the support response time. the non-cancelable term of our subscription arrangements typically ranges from one to three years but may be longer or shorter in limited circumstances and is typically billed annually in advance. the timing and billing of large, multi-year contracts can create variability in revenue and deferred revenue between periods. we also generate revenue from services, which represented 5%, 8% and 6% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. our services revenue is derived from our professional services related to the implementation or configuration of our platform and training. we have invested in building our services organization because we believe it plays an important role in customer success, ensuring that our customers fulfill their digital transformation agendas while leveraging our platform, accelerating our customers’ realization of the full benefits of our platform and driving increased adoption of our platform. our go-to-market strategy is focused on organizations that are modernizing existing applications or building net new applications. as an example, for large enterprises recognized as leaders in their respective industries, this could mean attempting to solve complicated business problems by digitally transforming their operations. for mid-size companies to start ups, this could be building a new product or service that seeks to disrupt an established market. as a result, couchbase powers a wide variety of applications across a broad array of industries, from some of the largest and most complex enterprise applications worldwide to the next generation of personalized dynamic apps. through our highly instrumented “sell-to” go-to-market motion, we have built a direct sales organization that understands the strategic needs of enterprises as well as a marketing organization that emphasizes our enablement of digital transformation through our no-compromises approach to performance, resiliency, scalability, agility and total cost of ownership (“tco”) savings. we complement our “sell-to” go-to-market motion with a “buy-from” go-to-market motion, which is focused on targeting the application developer community to drive adoption of our platform. to accomplish this, we have and plan to continue to invest in couchbase capella, our fully-managed database-as-a-service offering. we also offer free community editions of some of our products, free trials of our enterprise edition of couchbase server and couchbase capella products and a web browser-based demonstration version of couchbase server to further accelerate application developer adoption. we believe these offerings lead to future purchases of our paid products. while our community edition includes the core functionality of couchbase server, it is not suited for mission-critical deployments, as it offers only limited functionality around the scaled performance and security that enterprises require and no direct customer support from couchbase. we also continuously grow and cultivate our cloud provider partner and technology provider ecosystem. a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was attributable to our partner ecosystem. we employ a land-and-expand model centered around our platform offerings, which have a rapid time to production and time to value for our customers, and our sales and customer success organizations, which proactively guide customers to realize strategic and transformative use cases and drive greater adoption of our platform and services. our marketing organization is focused on building our brand reputation and awareness. our marketing initiatives drive awareness and demand for couchbase products, starting at the top of the sales funnel with trial experiences. as part of these efforts, we offer application developers robust educational resources including a robust and growing community to help them learn more about our platform, including access to on-demand instructional webinars. impact of macroeconomic conditions current macroeconomic conditions, including recessionary fears, inflation concerns, and rising interest rates as a result of government actions to combat inflation, as well as other geopolitical developments, have impacted and may continue to impact business spending and the economy as a whole. we continue to see longer deal cycles along with extra layers of scrutiny and approval, and customers electing to buy in smaller increments. additionally, effects from foreign exchange fluctuations have impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations. the effects of these macroeconomic conditions on our business and operations remains highly uncertain, and it is not possible for us to predict the duration and extent to which they will affect our business, future results of operations, and financial condition. see the section titled “risk factors” for further discussion of these challenges and risks. factors affecting our performance"
BASE,"continuing to acquire new customers we grow our subscription revenue by acquiring new customers. the size of our customer base may vary from period to period for several reasons, including the length of our sales cycle, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, enterprise application development cycles and the corresponding adoption rates of modern applications that require database solutions like ours. additionally, our revenue has and will vary as new customers purchase our products due to the fact that we recognize a portion of such subscription revenue upfront. as digital transformation continues to accelerate, we believe that couchbase capella, our fully-managed database-as-a-service offering, will become increasingly popular as a result of its compelling pricing model, ease of operation, lower tco, time to market and flexibility. we will continue to offer couchbase capella and provide flexible, highly available and differentiated economical options to capture new customers. continuing to expand within existing customers a significant part of our growth has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by expansion within our existing customer base. growth of our revenue from our existing customers results from increases in the scale of their deployment for existing use cases, or when customers utilize our platform to address new use cases. in addition, our professional services organization helps customers deploy new use cases and optimize their existing implementations. our revenue from our subscription offerings varies depending on the scale and performance requirements of our customers’ deployments. we are focusing on growing our subscription revenue, particularly from enterprises, while delivering professional services and training to support this growth. we have been successful in expanding our existing customers’ adoption of our platform as demonstrated by our dollar-based net retention rate of over 115% in the past nine quarters. our dollar-based net retention rate for any period equals the simple arithmetic average of our quarterly dollar-based net retention rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent fiscal quarter. to calculate our dollar-based net retention rate for a given quarter, we start with the arr (“base arr”) attributable to our customers (“base customers”) as of the end of the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. we then determine the arr attributable to the base customers as of the end of the most recent quarter and divide that amount by the base arr."
BASE,"continuing to invest in growth we expect to continue to invest in our offerings, personnel, geographic presence and infrastructure in order to drive future growth, as well as to pursue adjacent opportunities. we expend research and development resources to drive innovation in our proprietary software to constantly improve the functionality and performance of our platform and to increase the deployment models available to our customers. we anticipate continuing to increase our headcount to ensure that our product development organization drives improvements in our product offerings, our sales and marketing organization can maximize opportunities for growing our business and revenue and our general and administrative organization efficiently supports the growth of our business as well as our effective operation as a public company."
BASE,key business metrics
BASE,"annual recurring revenue we define arr, which also includes revenue from consumption-based cloud credits of couchbase capella products, as of a given date as the annualized recurring revenue that we would contractually receive from our customers in the month ending 12 months following such date. based on historical experience with customers, we assume all contracts will be automatically renewed at the same levels unless we receive notification of non-renewal and are no longer in negotiations prior to the measurement date. in the case of couchbase capella arr, for products in a customer’s initial year the calculation is as described above; after a customer’s initial year it is calculated by annualizing the prior 90 days of actual consumption, assuming no increases or reductions in usage. as of january 31, 2024, couchbase capella arr was approximately $21.8 million. arr excludes revenue derived from the use of cloud products only based on on-demand arrangements and services revenue. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent our revenue under gaap on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal dates. arr is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of revenue. although we seek to increase arr as part of our strategy of targeting large enterprise customers, this metric may fluctuate from period to period based on our ability to acquire new customers and expand within our existing customers. we believe that our arr is an important indicator of the growth and performance of our business."

BASE,"non-gaap financial measures in addition to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap, we believe certain non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. we use certain non-gaap financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. we believe that non-gaap financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding gaap financial measures, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. non-gaap financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly-titled non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. in addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-gaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures as tools for comparison. investors are encouraged to review the related gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. we define the non-gaap financial measures below as their respective gaap measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes on employee stock transactions, impairment of capitalized internal-use software and restructuring charges. we use these non-gaap financial measures in conjunction with gaap measures to assess our performance, including in the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we have excluded the impairment of capitalized internal-use software, a non-cash operating expense, from our non-gaap results as it is not reflective of ongoing operating results. this impairment charge relates to certain previously capitalized internal-use software that we determined would no longer be placed into service. prior period non-gaap financial measures have not been adjusted to reflect this change as we did not incur impairment of capitalized internal-use software in any prior period presented. beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have excluded employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, which is a cash expense, from our non-gaap results. these payroll taxes have been excluded from our non-gaap results because they are tied to the timing and size of the exercise or vesting of the underlying equity awards, and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. prior period non-gaap financial measures have not been adjusted to reflect this change, and the effect of this change is not material for any period previously presented."

BASE,components of results of operations
BASE,"revenue we derive revenue from sales of subscriptions and services. our subscription revenue is primarily derived from: (1) term-based software licenses sold in conjunction with post-contract support (“pcs” or “support”) and (2) a consumption-based database-as-a-service offering. pcs bundled with software licenses includes internet, email and phone support, bug fixes and the right to receive unspecified software updates and upgrades released when and if available during the subscription term. the software license is presented as “license.” pcs and database-as-a-service revenue are presented as “support and other” in our consolidated statements of operations. license revenue is recognized upon transfer when our customer has received access to our software. the pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the date when access to the subscription is made available to the customer and represents a substantial majority of our revenue. the database-as-a-service revenue is recognized on a consumption basis. the non-cancelable term of our subscription arrangements typically ranges from one to three years but may be longer or shorter in limited circumstances. our services revenue is derived from our professional services for the implementation or configuration of our platform and training. services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures for professional services and upon delivery for training. we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of new subscriptions, the proportion of term license contracts that commence within the period, the rate of customer renewals and expansions, the length of sales cycles and timing, delivery of professional services and training and fluctuations in customer consumption of our database-as-a-service offering. cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of personnel-related costs associated with our customer support organization, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our customer support organization, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, amortization of costs associated with capitalized internal-use software related to our database-as-a-service offering and allocated overhead. there is no cost of revenue associated with our license revenue. we expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases and as we continue to amortize capitalized internal-use software costs related to our database-as-a-service offering. cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel-related costs associated with our professional services and training organization, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation, costs of contracted third-party partners for professional services, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our professional services and training organization, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. we expect our cost of services revenue to fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and delivery of professional services and training. gross profit and gross margin our gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the average sales price of our subscriptions and services, the mix of subscriptions and services we sell and the associated revenue, the mix of geographies into which we sell and transaction volume growth. we expect our gross profit and gross margin to fluctuate in the near term depending on the interplay of these factors, and to the extent the revenue from our database-as-a-service offering increases as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our gross margin will decline over time. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, sales commissions and stock-based compensation expenses. research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and allocated overhead. we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the features and functionalities of our platform. we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organization, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, amortization of deferred commissions, fees for professional services related to sales and marketing, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers and deepen our engagement with existing customers. we expect sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue in the near term as we continue to invest in growing the reach of our platform through our sales and marketing efforts, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel. in addition, general and administrative expenses include non-personnel costs, such as fees for professional services such as external legal, accounting and other professional services, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative organization, certain taxes other than income taxes and allocated overhead. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the growth of our business and operate as a publicly-traded company. we expect general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business."
BASE,impairment of capitalized internal-use software impairment of capitalized-internal use software consists of non-cash impairment charges for certain previously capitalized internal-use software that would no longer be placed into service.
BASE,"restructuring restructuring expenses primarily consist of efforts we have undertaken to improve operational efficiency. restructuring activities include employee severance and related costs and stock-based compensation expense from modifications of vested awards granted to certain employees impacted by our restructuring plan. for further information on restructuring expense, refer to note 12 in the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10-k. interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on borrowings and unused credit facility fees related to our svb credit facility, which was terminated on june 5, 2023."
BASE,"other income (expense), net other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency and interest income. provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. we recorded a full valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on the timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of nols and tax credits. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):"

BASE,"operating activities cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2024 of $26.9 million primarily consisted of our net loss of $80.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $72.3 million and net cash outflows of $19.0 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected a $24.8 million increase in deferred commissions related to increased sales during the period, a $5.4 million increase in accounts receivable related to timing of billings and collections, a $3.4 million decrease in lease liabilities driven by monthly rental payments for operating leases, a $2.3 million increase in prepaid expenses, and a $1.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to the timing of accruals and payments. this was partially offset by a $9.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of billings, a $5.5 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due to increases in bonuses resulting from higher headcount, commissions due to higher bookings, related payroll taxes and increased espp contributions, and a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments. cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2023 of $41.2 million primarily consisted of our net loss of $68.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $49.0 million and net cash outflows of $21.7 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected a $17.6 million increase in deferred commissions related to increased sales during the period, a $3.5 million increase in accounts receivable related to timing of billings and collections, a $3.5 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits primarily due to fewer employee contributions related to the 2021 employee stock purchase plan, or the espp, and a $2.8 million decrease in lease liabilities due to monthly rental payments for operating leases. this was partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of billings and a $3.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments, including restructuring costs. investing activities cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2024 of $15.4 million consisted of maturities of short-term investments net of purchases of $20.1 million and additions to property and equipment of $4.7 million. cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2023 of $23.4 million consisted of purchases of short-term investments net of maturities of $17.7 million and additions to property and equipment of $5.6 million. financing activities cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2024 of $12.9 million consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises of $10.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $2.0 million. cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2023 of $9.7 million consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises of $5.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of $4.5 million. contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations consist of purchase obligations and operating lease commitments. purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. these obligations relate to third-party cloud infrastructure agreements and subscription arrangements. our operating lease commitments relate primarily to our office facilities."
BASE,"for further information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to note 9 in the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10-k."
BASE,"indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors and other business partners with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. additionally, we entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. to date, no demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements, and there are no claims that we are aware of that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected."
BASE,"the critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below."
BASE,"revenue recognition we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification, or asc, topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. we derive revenue from sales of subscriptions and services. subscription revenue consists of revenue from: (1) term-based software licenses sold in conjunction with post-contract support (“pcs” or “support”) and (2) a consumption-based database-as-a-service offering. pcs bundled with software licenses includes internet, email and phone support, bug fixes and the right to receive unspecified software updates and upgrades released when and if available during the subscription term. the software license is presented as “license.” pcs and database-as-a-service revenue are presented as “support and other” in our consolidated statements of operations. the software license in the subscription is a distinct performance obligation from pcs. license revenue is recognized upon transfer when our customer has received access to our software. the pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning on the date when access to the subscription is made available to our customer and represents a substantial majority of our revenue. performance obligations related to our database-as-a-service offering are recognized on a usage-basis as the consumption of this service represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the services transferred to date relative to the remaining services promised under the contract. the non-cancelable term of our subscription arrangements typically ranges from one to three years but may be longer or shorter in limited circumstances. we typically bill subscription revenue annually in advance. customer on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and are billed monthly in arrears. our services revenue is derived from professional services for the implementation or configuration of our platform and training. services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures for professional services and upon delivery for training. professional services are provided primarily on a fixed fee basis and are generally invoiced upfront, and training is generally priced on number of seats purchased. these services are distinct from software licenses, database-as-a-service offerings and pcs. revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are performed. determining whether the software license and the related pcs are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation requires significant judgment. we have concluded that the software license, which is recognized upon transfer to the customer, and pcs, which is recognized over the term of the arrangement, are two separately identifiable performance obligations. arrangements that include multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative ssp of the performance obligation. determining the relative ssp for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations requires significant judgement. when appropriate, we determine ssp based on the price at which the performance obligation has previously been sold through past transactions. we determine ssp for performance obligations with no observable evidence using adjusted market, cost plus or residual methods. when the ssp of a subscription including bundled software license and pcs is highly variable and the contract also includes additional performance obligations with observable ssp, we first allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations with established ssps and then apply the residual approach to allocate the remaining transaction price to the subscription."
BASE,"stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock awards based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. the fair value of restricted stock units is estimated using the current market price of our common stock on the date of grant. the fair value of stock options granted under the 2021 equity incentive plan, and purchase rights issued to employees under the espp, is based on the black-scholes option-pricing model. stock-based compensation expense for service-based vesting restricted stock units and stock options are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. we account for forfeitures as they occur. stock-based compensation expense related to the 2021 employee stock purchase plan is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. the black-scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected option term, expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, and expected dividend yield. the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management’s best estimates. these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. our assumptions and estimates are as follows: fair value of common stock. prior to our ipo, the fair value was determined by our board of directors with input from management and contemporaneous independent third-party valuations. subsequent to our ipo, the fair value of our common stock is based on the daily average selling price on the nasdaq global select market. expected term. the expected term represents the weighted-average period the stock-based awards are expected to remain outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. the simplified method calculates the expected term as the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the option. expected volatility. the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities for industry peers, as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock. risk-free interest rate. the risk-free rate assumption is based on the u.s. treasury instruments whose term was consistent with the option’s expected term. dividend yield. we utilize a dividend yield of zero. we do not currently declare or pay dividends on common stock, nor do we expect to do so in the foreseeable future. market-based rsus the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock unit awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation model that utilizes significant assumptions, including volatility, that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award. due to the limited history of trading of our common stock, we determined expected volatility based on a peer group of publicly traded companies. we recognize expense over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market-based performance conditions are satisfied, adjusted for pre-vesting forfeitures as they occur."
BASE,recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
BASE,"jobs act accounting election we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the jobs act. the jobs act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. this provision allows an “emerging growth company” to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. we have elected to use the extended transition period under the jobs act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an “emerging growth company” or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the jobs act. as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates."
NOW,item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
NOW,"this section of our annual report on form 10-k discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (“gaap”). a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that is not included in this annual report on form 10-k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed on january 31, 2023. our free cash flow measure included in the section entitled “—key business metrics—free cash flow,” is not in accordance with gaap. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. we encourage investors to carefully consider our results under gaap, as well as our supplemental non-gaap results, to more fully understand our business."
NOW,"overview servicenow was founded on a simple premise: to make work flow better. our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. our intelligent platform, the now platform, is a cloud-based solution with embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that helps global enterprises across industries, universities and governments unify and digitize their workflows. the now platform automates workflows across an entire enterprise by connecting disparate departments, systems and silos in a seamless way to unlock productivity and improve experiences for both employees and customers. our workflow applications built on the now platform are organized along four primary areas: technology, customer and industry, employee and creator. the transformation to digital operations, enabled by the now platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their c-suite, employees and consumers. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the russian invasion of ukraine and the current armed conflict in israel and the gaza strip. while these events are still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not believe the conflicts will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. however, if the conflicts continue or worsen, leading to greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted. our customers in these regions represented an immaterial portion of our net assets and total consolidated revenues both as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. additionally, other macroeconomic events, including rising interest rates, global inflation and bank failures, have led to economic uncertainty in the global economy. to mitigate risk, our cash and cash equivalents are distributed across several large financial institutions and are not concentrated in one financial institution. we have not experienced any impact to our liquidity or to our current and projected business operations and financial condition due to recent bank failures. further, we have policy restrictions on the types of securities that can be purchased as part of our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio. these restrictions take industry and company concentration limits into consideration among other things. furthermore, the majority of our non-marketable equity investments do not have material relationships with any one financial institution, and therefore, we believe that our exposure to loss is immaterial. we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impact of macroeconomic events on our business and financial results. see the “risk factors” section in part i, item 1a of this annual report for further discussion of the possible impact of the above conflicts and macroeconomic events on our business and financial results. key business metrics remaining performance obligations. transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (“rpo”) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. rpo excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. current remaining performance obligations (“crpo”) represents rpo that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. as of december 31, 2023, our rpo was $18.0 billion, of which 48% represented crpo. rpo and crpo increased by 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to december 31, 2022. factors that may cause our rpo to vary from period to period include the following: foreign currency exchange rates. while a majority of our contracts have historically been in u.s. dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the euro and british pound sterling. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our rpo. mix of offerings. in a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. in self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from rpo."
NOW,"subscription start date. from time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in rpo if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date. timing of contract renewals. while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. for example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. in other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. contract duration. while we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. further, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the u.s. federal government throughout the year, with the highest number of agreements entered into in the quarter ended september 30, driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures. we sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. the contract duration will cause variability in our rpo. number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with annual contract value (“acv”) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 1,897, 1,643, and 1,350 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. for purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate (“gult”) data universal numbering system (“duns”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to “government of the united states” under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we believe information regarding the total number of customers with acv greater than $1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the now platform. free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities plus cash outflows for legal settlements, repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount and business combination and other related costs including compensation expense, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. a calculation of free cash flow is provided below:"
NOW,"year ended december 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) free cash flow: net cash provided by operating activities $3,398 $2,723 $2,191 purchases of property and equipment (694) (550) (392) repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount — — 15 business combination and other related costs 24 7 53 free cash flow $2,728 $2,180 $1,867"
NOW,"we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts, which is significantly higher in the quarter ended december 31. additionally, we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended march 31 and september 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, payouts under our bonus plans and coupon payments related to our 2030 notes beginning in 2021. renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total acv from all customers lost during the period. accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewals. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. for our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number. we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful."
NOW,"critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material. while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. revenue recognition we derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues, which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. for our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancellable and without any refund-type provisions. subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. for these contracts, we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“ssp”) basis. the transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. for these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis. evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third parties. commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years consistent with prior year. commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. determining the period of benefit, including average renewal term, requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors."
NOW,"business combinations the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, revenue growth rates, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions as new information is obtained and may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed but not later than one year from the acquisition date."
NOW,"income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense (benefit) and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. a release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. in making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. as of june 30, 2023, we achieved cumulative u.s. income during the prior twelve quarters when considering pre-tax income adjusted for permanent differences and other comprehensive losses. based on all available positive and negative evidence, having demonstrated sustained profitability which is objective and verifiable, and taking into account anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more likely than not that our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realizable, with the exception of california. we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our california deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding realizability of these deferred tax assets as they have not met the “more likely than not” realization criteria, particularly as we expect research and development tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use the credits in future years. of the $1.2 billion valuation allowance as of december 31, 2022, we released $1.05 billion of our valuation allowance during the year ended december 31, 2023. we maintained a valuation allowance of $196 million against our california deferred tax assets. we will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. see note 16 – income taxes, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on discussion on valuation allowance. our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination."
NOW,"change in accounting estimate in january 2024, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of data center equipment from four to five years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2024. based on the carrying amount of data center equipment included in property and equipment, net that are in-service as of december 31, 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by approximately $100 million."

NOW,"revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related standard and enhanced support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. for our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. for self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancellable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. professional services and other revenues. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee. professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. we sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. we also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners. we also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 79% of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. for purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization. seasonality. we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. the increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures, and the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by december 31. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality of entering into customer agreements is sometimes not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. in addition, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the u.s. federal government throughout the year, with the highest number of agreements entered into in the third quarter, driven primarily by the timing of their annual budget expenditures. this larger mix of contracts with 12-month renewal terms in the third quarter will generally cause variability in our rpo and crpo in subsequent quarters until they are renewed. although these seasonal factors may be common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance."
NOW,"cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, it services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead. professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 10%, 12% and 14% for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. in addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, marketing program expenses, which include events such as knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead. research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. (benefit from) provision for income taxes (benefit from) provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against certain u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, excluding california. we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our california deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding realizability of these deferred tax assets as they have not met the “more likely than not” realization criteria, particularly as we expect research and development tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use the credits in future years. comparison of the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022"

founded sentinelone in 2013 with a dramatically new approach to cybersecurity. we pioneered the world’s first purpose-built ai-powered extended detection and response (xdr) platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous, from the endpoint and beyond. our singularity platform instantly defends against cyberattacks — performing at a faster speed, greater scale, and higher accuracy than otherwise possible from a human-powered approach. our singularity platform ingests, correlates, and queries petabytes of structured and unstructured data from a myriad of ever-expanding disparate external and internal sources in real-time. we build rich context and deliver greater visibility by constructing a dynamic representation of data across an organization. as a result, our ai models are highly accurate, actionable, and autonomous. our distributed ai models run both locally on every endpoint and every cloud workload, as well as on our cloud platform. our static and vector-agnostic behavioral ai models, which run on the endpoints themselves, provide our customers with protection even when their devices are not connected to the cloud. in the cloud, our streaming ai detects anomalies that surface when multiple data feeds are correlated. by providing full visibility into the storyline of every secured device across the organization through one console, our platform makes it very fast for analysts to easily search through petabytes of data to investigate incidents and proactively hunt threats. we have extended our control and visibility planes beyond the traditional endpoint to unmanaged iot devices. our singularity platform can be flexibly deployed on the environments that our customers choose, including public, private, or hybrid clouds. our feature parity across windows, macos, linux, and kubernetes offers best-of-breed protection, visibility, and control across today’s heterogeneous it environments. together, these capabilities make our platform the logical choice for organizations of all sizes, industry verticals, and compliance requirements. our platform offers true multi-tenancy, which enables some of the world’s largest organizations and our managed security providers and incident response partners with an excellent management experience. our customers realize improved cybersecurity outcomes with fewer people. we generate substantially all of our revenue by selling subscriptions to our singularity platform. our subscription tiers include singularity core, singularity control, and singularity complete. we also offer product bundles that include singularity commercial and singularity enterprise. additionally, customers can extend the functionality of our platform through our subscription singularity modules. we generally price our subscriptions and modules on a per agent basis, and each agent generally corresponds with an endpoint, server, virtual machine, or container. our subscription contracts typically range from one to three years. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of a contract. most of our contracts are for terms representing annual increments, therefore contracts generally come up for renewal in the same period in subsequent years. the timing of large multi-year enterprise contracts can create some variability in subscription order levels between periods, though the impact to our revenue in any particular period is limited as a result of ratable revenue recognition. our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving expanded usage of our platform by existing customers. our sales organization is comprised of our enterprise sales, inside sales and customer solutions engineering teams. it leverages our global network of independent software vendors (isvs), alliance partners, and channel partners for prospect access. additionally, our sales teams work closely with our customers, channel partners, and alliance partners to drive adoption of our platform, and our software solutions are fulfilled through our channel partners. our channel partners include some of the world’s largest resellers and distributors, managed service providers (msps), managed security service providers (mssps), managed detection and response providers (mdrs), original equipment manufacturers (oems), and incident response (ir) firms. once customers experience the benefits of our platform, they often upgrade their subscriptions to benefit from the full range of our extended detection and response (xdr), it, and security operations capabilities. additionally, many of our customers adopt singularity modules over time to extend the functionality of our platform and increase their coverage footprint. the combination of platform upgrades and extended modules drives our powerful land-and-expand motion. our singularity platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. we had 1,133 customers with annualized recurring revenue (arr) of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2024, up from 872 customers with arr of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2023. we define arr as the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and consumption and usage-based agreements at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, no single end customer accounted for more than 3% of our arr. our revenue outside of the us represented 36% and 35% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, illustrating the global nature of our solutions. we have grown rapidly since our inception. our revenue was $621.2 million, $422.2 million, and $204.8 million for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 47% and 106%, respectively. during this period, we continued to invest in growing our business to capitalize on our market opportunity. as a result, our net loss for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $338.7 million, $378.7 million, and $271.1 million, respectively. impact of global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. worsening economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate volatility, slower growth, potential recession, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, actual or perceived instability in the global banking industry, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, and other changes in economic conditions, and the impact of natural or man-made global events, including wars and other regional geopolitical armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, may result in decreased sales productivity and growth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. as a result of the current macroeconomic environment, we have recently experienced certain impacts on our business, including a decline in usage and consumption patterns from certain customers, especially larger enterprise customers, longer sales cycles, and deal downsizing by new customers and of renewals by existing customers, especially larger enterprises. we intend to continue to monitor global macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions to the extent our business begins to be adversely impacted. for example, in june 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the plan) designed to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce and operations with current business needs, priorities, and near-term growth expectations. the actions associated with the plan are expected to be fully complete by the end of fiscal 2025, subject to finalizing the disposition of certain office space. we incurred approximately $7.4 million in charges in connection with the plan in fiscal 2024, consisting of severance payments and employee benefits, impairment charges related to excess facilities and inventory write-offs, offset partially by savings related to the reversal on stock-based compensation expense. we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in the middle east which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. however, if the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations. we are unable to predict the full impact that macroeconomic or other geopolitical factors will have on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the actions that may be taken by government authorities across the us or other countries, changes in central bank policies and interest rates, rates of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential, government shutdowns related thereto, regional geopolitical conflicts, the impact to our customers, partners, and suppliers, and other factors described in the section titled “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10-k. key business metrics and non-gaap financial measures we monitor the following key metrics and non-gaap financial measures to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. revenue we discuss revenue below under “components of our results of operations.”"

S,"non-gaap operating loss in addition to our results determined in accordance with gaap, we use non-gaap operating loss as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. we believe that non-gaap operating loss provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this measure excludes, among other expenses, expenses that we do not consider to be indicative of our overall operating performance. non-gaap operating loss is calculated as gaap operating loss adjusted to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related compensation, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, and payroll tax related to stock-based compensation. non-gaap operating loss has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap, including gaap operating loss. other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-gaap measures, including non-gaap operating loss, differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures as tools for comparison. as a result, our non-gaap operating loss is presented for supplemental informational purposes only."

S,"annualized recurring revenue (arr) we believe that arr is a key operating metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription and consumption and usage-based customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing customers. arr represents the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and consumption and usage-based agreements at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. arr is an operational metric and is not a non-gaap metric. arr is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates, usage, renewal rates, and other contractual terms."

S,"*arr as of january 31, 2023 and 2022 reflect the one-time arr adjustment of approximately 5% made in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. arr grew 39% year-over-year to $724.4 million for fiscal 2024, primarily due to high growth in the number of new customers purchasing our subscriptions and to additional purchases by existing customers. as a result of the decline in usage and consumption in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we changed our methodology of calculating arr for consumption and usage-based agreements to reflect committed contract values as opposed to based on consumption and usage. by making this change, we expect future arr and revenue growth to be more closely aligned. it should also reduce volatility in arr compared to the prior methodology where usage and consumption changes could have a magnified impact on arr. in addition, as part of our quarter-end review of arr in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended april 30, 2023, we discovered some historical upsell and renewal recording inaccuracies relating to arr on certain contracts, which we have corrected. as a result of the change in methodology and correction of historical inaccuracies, we made a one-time adjustment to arr of $27 million or approximately 5% of total arr, which we reflected in our total arr as of january 31, 2023. arr for the prior periods in fiscal 2023 and 2022 presented above have been adjusted based on the same percentage adjustment rate identified in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. this adjustment to arr did not impact historical total bookings or revenue. customers with arr of $100,000 or more we believe that our ability to increase the number of customers with arr of $100,000 or more is an indicator of our market penetration and strategic demand for our platform. we define a customer as an entity that has an active subscription for access to our platform. we count msps, mssps, mdrs, and oems, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. we do not count our reseller or distributor channel partners as customers."

S,"our nrr of 114% was driven by existing customers adoption of additional endpoint licenses and adjacent platform solutions. a larger portion of our business mix was driven by new customers in 2024, which will open doors for platform adoption over time. we see significant long-term expansion potential based on high customer retention rates, expanding product categories, and early-stage adoption from our installed base."
S,components of our results of operations
S,"revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our singularity platform. customers can extend the functionality of their subscription to our platform by subscribing to additional singularity modules. subscriptions provide access to hosted software. the nature of our promise to the customer under the subscription is to provide protection for the duration of the contractual term and as such is considered as a series of distinct services. our arrangements may include fixed consideration, variable consideration, or a combination of the two. fixed consideration is recognized over the term of the arrangement or longer if the fixed consideration relates to a material right. variable consideration in these arrangements is typically a function of transaction volume or another usage-based measure. depending upon the structure of a particular arrangement, we i) allocate the variable amount to each distinct service period within the series and recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e. direct allocation), ii) estimate total variable consideration at contract inception (giving consideration to any constraints that may apply and updating the estimates as new information becomes available) and recognizes the total transaction price over the period to which it relates, or iii) apply the ‘right to invoice’ practical expedient and recognize revenue based on the amount invoiced to the customer during the period. premium support and maintenance and other singularity modules are distinct from subscriptions and are recognized ratably over the term as the performance obligations are satisfied. we invoice our customers upfront upon signing for the entire term of the contract, periodically, or in arrears. most of our subscription contracts have a term of one to three years. cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with the hosting and maintenance of our platform. cost of revenue also consists of personnel-related costs associated with our customer support and services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use software, software and subscription services used by our customer support and services team, inventory-related costs, and allocated overhead costs. our third-party cloud infrastructure costs are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of endpoints per customer, the number of modules, and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules. we plan to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure and additional resources in our customer support and services organization as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue from period to period. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. operating expenses also include allocated facilities and it overhead costs. research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. research and development expenses also include consulting fees, software and subscription services, and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform and modules. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase investments in our existing products and services. however, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses. in addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment related expenses, advertising, branding and marketing events, promotions, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and software and subscription services. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third parties that are incremental to obtain a subscription contract. such costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of four years, and any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription are capitalized and amortized over the average contractual term of the renewal. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base, but to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other expenses for our executive, finance, legal, people team, and facilities organizations. general and"
S,"administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, other consulting, and professional services fees, software and subscription services, and other corporate expenses. we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time."
S,"restructuring restructuring charges, related to the plan, consist primarily of charges related to severance payments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and impairment charges related to excess facilities. the actions associated with the plan are expected to be fully complete by the end of fiscal 2025, subject to finalizing the disposition of certain office space. interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and investments. interest expense consists primarily of the amortization of the discount related to the attivo indemnity escrow liability. other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and gains and losses on strategic investments."
S,"provision for (benefit from) income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and a one-time benefit from the release of valuation allowance as a result of the attivo acquisition during fiscal 2023. in connection with our global consolidated losses, we maintain a full valuation allowance against our us and israel deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:"

S,"the provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in foreign taxes related to operations in international subsidiaries and a one-time tax benefit from the application of our deferred assets with a full valuation allowance to net deferred tax liability of attivo acquired intangibles recorded in fiscal 2023. in connection with the acquisition of attivo, which closed in may 2022, we recorded a net deferred tax liability primarily attributable to identifiable acquired intangibles. this net deferred tax liability is considered an additional source of income to support the realizability of our deferred tax asset, and as a result we released a portion of the valuation allowance and recorded a one-time discrete tax benefit of $9.7 million in fiscal 2023."
S,"liquidity and capital resources in july 2021, upon completion of our ipo and the concurrent private placement, we received net proceeds of $1.4 billion, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of $81.6 million. we did not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to shares that were sold in the private placement. we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities, payments received from our customers, and borrowings under a now-terminated loan and security agreement, and we have generated operating losses, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. we expect these and other operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future. we also expect to incur significant research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business. as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. in the short term, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. in the long term beyond the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including global macroeconomic conditions, our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase third-party cloud infrastructure, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. we have, and in the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. in the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. we hold our cash, cash equivalents, and investments with a diverse group of banking partners. however, any instability in the us or global banking system or relating to the federal budget may impact liquidity both in the short term and long term and may result in adverse impacts to our or our customers’ business, including in our customers’ ability to pay for our platform."

S,"off-balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the us. the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows will be affected."
S,"the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below."
S,"revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. we consider the terms and conditions of contracts with customers and our customary business practices in identifying contracts. we determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, the payment terms for the services can be identified, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and we have determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay. we apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to such customer. our contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations, which are accounted for separately if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. certain sales arrangements may include variable consideration, which is recorded as part of the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur. business combinations we account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include, but are not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, forecasted revenue, discount rates, and useful lives. management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements."
