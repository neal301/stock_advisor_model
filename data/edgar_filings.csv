S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"item 1a. risk factors investing in our class a common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included before making a decision to invest in our class a common stock. our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our class a common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. summary risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those risks more fully described below. these risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks: risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment. we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. adverse global macroeconomic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability, and regulatory exposure, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely affect our customer relationships and overall business. we may not be able to timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"risks related to regulatory matters if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share, or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. risks related to our people we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. risks related to our intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us. third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights, and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our ipo, including our directors, executive officers, and other beneficial owners who hold in the aggregate approximately 72% of the voting power of our capital stock, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment. we were founded in january 2013 and released our first endpoint security solution in february 2015. our limited operating history and financial data may make it difficult to evaluate our current business, future prospects and other trends. we have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries and sectors, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable or established market. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to fluctuations in our markets or otherwise, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business and operating results would be adversely affected. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future. the risks associated with having a limited operating history may be exacerbated by current global macroeconomic conditions. we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. we have incurred net losses in all periods since our inception, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we experienced a net loss of $338.7 million and $378.7 million for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. as of january 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. while we have historically experienced significant growth in revenue, we cannot predict when or whether we will reach or maintain profitability. we also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to drive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers in new geographic locations, which will negatively affect our operating results if our total revenue does not increase. in addition to the anticipated costs to grow our business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a public company, particularly now that we are no longer an emerging growth company. our revenue growth is expected to slow as we grow and our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our platform, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities, including acquisitions, new products, services, and feature releases. while we consistently evaluate opportunities to reduce our operating costs and optimize efficiencies, including, for example, our restructuring plan in june 2023, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that we will not re-accelerate operating expenditures in the future in order to capitalize on growth opportunities. if we fail to increase our revenue to offset increases in our operating expenses or manage our costs as we invest in our business, we may not achieve or sustain profitability."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the market for cybersecurity products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and is rapidly evolving, characterized by changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and frequent introductions of new or improved products and services. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market, as our competitors complete strategic acquisitions or form cooperative relationships and/or customer requirements evolve. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we would experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. for a description of our competitors, see the section titled “business—competition.” our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: our ability to attract and retain new customers, expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers; our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate talented employees; our ability to successfully incorporate new technologies into our platform, including ai; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of our customers, including any slowdown in technology spending due to us and general global macroeconomic conditions; general global macroeconomic and political conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including global economic slowdowns, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and potential global recession; the impact of natural or man-made global events on our business, including wars and other armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and the tensions between china and taiwan; changes in customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs; price competition; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or customers and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors; changes in our mix of products, subscriptions and services sold, including changes in the average contract length for subscriptions and support; our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally; changes in the growth rate of endpoint security, cloud security, and overall cybersecurity product platform and services sectors; deferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new or enhanced products and services announced by us or our competitors; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to the use of our platform; the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies, businesses, or strategic partnerships; our ability to execute, complete, or efficiently integrate any acquisitions that we may undertake; increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate; our ability to increase the size and productivity of our distribution channels; decisions by potential customers to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors; timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, which could increase due to us and global macroeconomic issues, including actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, inflation, interest rate volatility, and market downturns, which would adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our platform, products, and services in a timely manner or at all; the cost and potential outcomes of litigation or other proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do or bundle certain competing products and services at lower prices. our competitors may also have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, customer support and to pursue acquisitions, or they may have other financial, technical, or other resource advantages. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings and more mature distribution and go-to-market strategies, which allows them to leverage their existing customer and distributor relationships to gain business in a manner that discourages potential customers from purchasing our platform. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, including but not limited to increased advancements and proliferation in the use of open artificial intelligence applications, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made or could make acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive products and services than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margin, increased net losses, and loss of market share. even if there is significant demand for endpoint and cloud security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we will have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other cybersecurity providers is different and more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of purchasing products and services from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive action with respect to pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. our operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past, and we expect that our operating results will continue to vary significantly in the future such that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. this could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. fluctuations in quarterly results may negatively impact the trading price of our class a common stock. our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: general global macroeconomic and political conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including global economic slowdowns, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and potential global recession; the impact of natural or man-made global events on our business, including wars and other armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan; our ability to attract new and retain existing customers or sell additional features to existing customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers; the timing and length of our sales cycles; changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs; changes in the growth rate of the cybersecurity market generally and market for endpoint security; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us, including pinnacleone, our strategic risk analysis and advisory group, and singularity data lake, our live enterprise data platform for data queries, analytics, insights, and retention, or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors; the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our platform; our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; any disruption in our relationship with isvs, channel partners, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solution; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the use of our platform or other cybersecurity incidents; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes, taxes, regulatory fines or penalties; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices; negative media coverage or publicity; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; and increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in our fourth fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for the reasons described above or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action lawsuits. adverse global macroeconomic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. in addition, the purchase of our platform is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. weak global and regional economic conditions, including us and global macro-economic issues, actual or perceived global banking and finance related issues, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, spending environments, geopolitical instability, warfare and uncertainty, weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macro-economic conditions, including the effects of the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine, and tensions between china and taiwan and judicial reform in israel, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including resulting in longer sales cycles, a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers or expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers, lower prices for our platform, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced sales to new or existing customers and slower or declining growth. for example, as a result of current uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions and related higher cost consciousness around it budgets, we have recently experienced certain impacts on our business, including a decline in usage and consumption patterns from certain customers, especially larger enterprise customers, longer sales cycles, and deal downsizing by new customers and of renewals by existing customers, especially larger enterprises. we expect the global macroeconomic conditions impacting demand to persist in the near term. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. moreover, the us capital markets have experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. inflation rates in the us significantly increased in 2021 and 2022, resulting in federal action to increase interest rates, adversely affecting capital markets activity. further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and regulatory action may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are investing in expanding our platform, including our cloud security products, and it is difficult to predict adoption and demand. we are meaningfully investing in our platform, including growing our cloud security product. for example, in november 2023, through the acquisition of ksg, we launched pinnacleone, a strategic advisory group also operating as a think tank for hire, focused on helping companies and their executives holistically understand the evolving risks of operating in the modern global business landscape through personalized access to experts’ intelligence, insight, and transformative risk management strategies. further, in february 2024, we acquired pingsafe, a cloud security platform, which we expect will enable us to couple pingsafe’s cnapp with our cloud workload security and cloud data security capabilities. it is difficult to predict customer adoption and demand for our platform, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products and services or the success of existing competitive products and services. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with, and customer adoption of, our platform. if the market for our platform does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our software or our services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, implementation challenges for deployment, technological challenges, competing technologies and services, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders and decreased revenue, which would adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. our platform interoperates with, but does not necessarily replace, other security and log analytics products. businesses that use other cybersecurity products and services may be hesitant to purchase our platform if they believe their existing products and services provide a level of security that is sufficient to meet their needs. if we do not succeed in convincing customers that our platform should be an integral part of their overall approach to security, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. if businesses do not continue to adopt our platform for any of the reasons discussed above or for other reasons not contemplated, our sales would not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. we may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. we have recently begun incorporating generative ai into our offerings, including our purple ai solution dedicated to threat-hunting, analysis and response. as with many innovations, generative ai presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could impact our successful ability to incorporate the use of generative ai in our business. for example, language models may provide flawed results or misinterpret prompts. further, data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of ai solutions. this is turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analyses or other content that our ai-initiatives produce. in addition, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate generative ai solutions into their products more successfully than us, and their solutions may achieve higher market acceptance than ours, which may result in us failing to recoup our investments in developing generative ai-powered offerings. we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our ai technology, including in our purple ai solution. our ability to employ ai, or the ability of our competitors to do so more successfully, may negatively impact our gross margins, impair our ability to compete effectively, result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our operating results. moreover, ai may give rise to litigation risk, including potential intellectual property, privacy, or cybersecurity liability. because ai is an emerging technology, there is not a mature body of case law construing the appropriateness of certain of its uses of data - whether through the employment of large language models or other models leveraging data found on the internet - and the evolution of this law may limit our ability to exploit artificial intelligence tools, or expose us to litigation. further, ai presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of ai algorithms draws controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. in addition, given the complex nature of ai technology, we face an evolving regulatory landscape. for example, in october 2023, president biden issued an executive order that establishes new standards for, among other things, ai safety, security, and privacy. moreover, we are subject to significant competition from other companies, some of which have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources than us. our competitors may incorporate ai into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our financial results. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability and regulatory exposure, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. companies are subject to an increasing number and wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, ransomware, account takeover, business email compromise, employee fraud, theft or misuse, denial of service attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks that create risks for our internal networks and cloud deployed products and the information they store and process. cybersecurity companies face particularly intense attack efforts, and we have faced, and will continue to face, cyber threats and attacks from a variety of sources. the research that we conduct and report may make us, or our customers, a further target for attacks of all kinds. state-supported and geopolitical-related cyberattacks may rise in connection with regional geopolitical conflicts such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan. in addition, our cybersecurity product is likely considered a valuable target for lateral attacks because of its highly privileged access. moreover, the ongoing war in ukraine and associated activities in ukraine and russia have increased the risk of cyberattacks on various types of infrastructure and operations, and the us government has warned companies to be prepared for a significant increase in russian cyberattacks in response to the sanctions on russia. there may also be increased risks of cybersecurity attacks as a result of the unfolding events in the middle east. additionally, bad actors are beginning to utilize ai-based tools to execute attacks, creating unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. although we have implemented security measures to prevent such attacks, our networks and systems may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, human or employee error, insufficient cybersecurity controls, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our and/or our customers’ systems, networks, or data. we may face difficulties or delays in identifying or otherwise responding to any attacks or actual or potential security breaches or threats. these risks are exacerbated by developments in generative ai. a breach in our data security or an attack against our platform could impact our networks or the networks and data of our customers that are secured by our platform, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and providing access to malicious parties to information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers, resulting in data being publicly disclosed, misused, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and adversely affect our financial condition. if compromised, our own systems could be used to facilitate or magnify an attack. further, the increase in remote work by companies and individuals in recent years has generally increased the attack surface available to bad actors for exploitation, and as such, the risk of a cybersecurity incident potentially occurring has increased. we have accordingly increased our investments in protective measures and risk mitigation strategies, but we cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents. protecting our own assets has become more expensive from a dollar investment and time perspective and these costs may increase as the threat landscape increases, including as a result of use by bad actors of ai. any actual, alleged, or perceived security breach in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, costly litigation, and other liability. we would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations, and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information. for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (ccpa), as amended by the california privacy rights act (cpra), imposes a private right of action for security breaches that could lead to some form of remedy including regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. where a security incident involves a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alternation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data from the european economic area (eea) or the uk in respect of which we are a controller or processor under the general data protection regulation (gdpr), and the uk general data protection regulation and uk data protection act 2018 (uk gdpr), this could result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater, under the gdpr or up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater, in the case of the uk gdpr. we may also be required to provide notice of such breaches to regulators and/or individuals which may result in us incurring additional costs, penalties, fines or litigation. further, on july 26, 2023, the sec adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management (including the board’s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports on form 10-k. these cybersecurity disclosure rules also require the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents by form 8-k, within four business days of determining an incident is material. any public disclosure relating to a material cybersecurity incident, whether as a result of the new sec rules or otherwise, harm our reputation, result in litigation and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. in addition, certain of our customer agreements may require us to promptly report security breaches involving their data on our systems or those of subcontractors processing such data on our behalf. this mandatory disclosure could be costly, result in litigation, harm our reputation, erode customer trust, and require significant resources to mitigate issues stemming from actual or perceived security breaches. in addition, we may incur significant financial and operational costs to investigate, remediate, eliminate and put in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. any of these negative outcomes could adversely affect the market perception of our platform and customer and investor confidence in our company, and would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform and product features are multi-faceted and may be deployed with material defects, software “bugs” or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment to our customers. from time to time, certain of our customers have reported defects in our platform related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. our platform and product features also provide our customers with the ability to customize a multitude of settings, and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure our platform or otherwise fail to configure our products in an optimal manner. such defects and misconfigurations of our platform could cause our platform to operate at suboptimal efficacy, cause it to fail to secure customers’ computing environments and detect and block threats, or temporarily interrupt our customers’ computing environments. we also make frequent updates to our platform, which may fail, resulting in temporary vulnerability that increases the likelihood of a material defect. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage target computing environments change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our platform is unable to detect or prevent. furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, our networks, platform, products, including cloud-based technology, and customers could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business, harm our reputation or use our technology to gain unauthorized access. in addition, regional geopolitical conflicts such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, may result in increased cyberattacks against our customers, resulting in an increased risk of a security breach of our customers’ systems. in addition, defects or errors in our platform could result in a failure to effectively update customers’ cloud-based products. our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers’ computing environments, leaving their computing environments unprotected against cyber threats. any of these situations could result in negative publicity to us, damage our reputation, and increase expenses and customer relations issues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. advances in computer capabilities, discoveries of new weaknesses and other developments with software generally used by the internet community may increase the risk we will suffer a security breach. furthermore, our platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, ransomware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our platform to reflect industry trends, new technologies and new operating environments, the complexity of the environment of our clients and the sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. our platform may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons. we or our service providers may also suffer security breaches or unauthorized access to personal information, financial account information, and other confidential information due to employee error, rogue employee activity, unauthorized access by third parties acting with malicious intent or who commit an inadvertent mistake or social engineering. if we experience, or our service providers experience, any breaches of security measures or sabotage or otherwise suffer unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, personal information, financial account information or other confidential information, we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to address these problems. we may not be able to remedy any problems caused by hackers or other similar actors in a timely manner, or at all. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our platform does not provide significant value, our reputation and business would be harmed. any real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our platform, or any other failure of our platform to detect an advanced threat, could result in: a loss of existing or potential customers; delayed or lost revenue and adverse impacts to our business, operating results, and financial condition; a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance; the expenditure of significant financial and research and development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, and address and eliminate vulnerabilities; an increase in resources devoted to customer service and support, which could adversely affect our gross margin; harm to our reputation or brand; and claims and litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, enforcement actions, and other claims and liabilities, all of which may be costly and burdensome and further harm our reputation. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are launched against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. moreover, if a high-profile cybersecurity incident occurs with respect to another saas provider, customers may lose trust in the security of the saas business model generally, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. in the last few years there have been many successful advanced cybersecurity incidents that have damaged several prominent companies despite strong information security measures. we expect that the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents and the costs of preventing such attacks will continue to increase in the future. in addition, we cannot assure you that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers, or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter or as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the us, or other countries. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our reputation. we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services, products, technologies, or talent. for example, in february 2021 we acquired scalyr, a data analytics company, in may 2022 we acquired attivo, a leading identity security and lateral movement protection company, in november 2023 we acquired ksg, a strategic advisory group, and in february 2024 we acquired both pingsafe, a cloud security platform, and stride, a security automation company. we have also invested in certain privately held companies through our s ventures fund, and we may not realize a return on these investments. all of our venture investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner is not guaranteed. in the future, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. our due diligence efforts may fail to identify all of the challenges, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings involved in an acquisition. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we announce or complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or investors. in addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating existing and future acquisitions, or the technologies and personnel associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. additionally, integrations could take longer than expected, or if we move too quickly in trying to integrate an acquisition, strategic investment, partnership, or other alliance, we may fail to achieve the desired efficiencies. we have, and may in the future have, to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders, which depending on the size of the acquisition, may be significant. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include: diversion of management’s time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; the inability to coordinate research and development and sales and marketing functions; the inability to integrate product and service offerings; retention of key employees from the acquired company; changes in relationships with strategic partners or the loss of any key customers or partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition; cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; integration of the acquired company’s accounting, customer relationship management, management information, human resources and other administrative systems; the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies; unexpected security risks or higher than expected costs to improve the security posture of the acquired company; higher than expected costs to bring the acquired company’s it infrastructure up to our standards; additional legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements; financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we don’t adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect; liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment; and litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from or against terminated employees, customers, current and former stockholders, or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. historically, we have experienced rapid growth in the adoption of our platform, customer base, and revenue. however, we may not return to our prior growth rates or grow at the same rate in the future. any success that we may experience in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things: maintain, renew and expand our existing customer base; continue to attract new customers; induce customers to expand deployment of the initially adopted module(s) of our platform across their organizations and infrastructure, and to adopt additional modules of our platform and services; improve the capabilities of our platform through research and development; continue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; and successfully compete with other companies in the endpoint security industry. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one to three years, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths or cease using certain features. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solution, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition, general economic conditions, or the perceived decline in the incidence of cyberattacks. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, operating results, and financial condition will materially suffer. if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform must effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing it infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products and services from multiple vendors, and contains multiple generations of products and services that have been added over time. as a result, our solutions can sometimes encounter interoperability issues on deployment or over time, which require additional support and problem solving with customers, in some cases, at a substantial cost to us. we may modify our software or introduce new capabilities so that our platform interoperates with a customer’s infrastructure. these issues could cause longer deployment and integration times for our platform, leading to customer churn, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. in addition, government and other customers may require our platform to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. if we are unable to achieve, or are delayed in achieving, compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our platform to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely impact our customer relationships and overall business. our platform is hosted by third-party cloud hosting providers including aws. our software and systems are designed to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by such cloud hosting providers, and currently our cloud service infrastructure is primarily run on aws. we have experienced, and expect in the future that we may experience from time to time, interruptions, delays or outages in service availability due to a variety of factors. capacity constraints could arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks. the level of service provided by our cloud hosting providers, or regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also impact the use of, and our customers’ satisfaction with, our platform and could harm our business and reputation. in addition, hosting costs are expected to increase as our customer base grows, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, aws has discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us, including on contract renewal, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. aws, and other cloud hosting providers, may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, competing with us, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process data on their system in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. although we obtain services from other cloud hosting providers, if our current arrangement with aws were to be terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our content available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for expansion and transition to alternative cloud hosting and infrastructure services. such a transition could require further technical changes to our platform, including, but not limited to, our cloud service infrastructure which was initially designed to run on aws. making such changes could be costly in terms of time and financial resources. any of these factors could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause our customers to decline to renew their subscriptions, any of which would harm our business and operating results. we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grows. as our customers gain more experience with our platform, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, and the number of locations where our platform is being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications, and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. in some circumstances, we may also determine to scale our technology through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development, which may divert management’s time and resources. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solution, we will not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we will be unable to compete as effectively and our business and operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate and promptly respond to changes in our customers’ technologies, business plans or security needs, our competitive position and prospects will be adversely impacted. the cybersecurity market has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. moreover, many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network-connected endpoints and adapt to increasingly complex it environments, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. as their technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. we face significant challenges in ensuring that our platform effectively identifies and responds to these advanced and evolving attacks, including as a result of the evolving ai landscape. as a result of the continued rapid innovations in the technology industry, including the rapid growth of smartphones, tablets and other devices, enterprise employees using personal devices for work, the rapidly evolving internet of things and ai, we expect the networks of our customers to continue to change rapidly and become more complex. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, enhancements to our platform that adequately address the changing needs of our customers. in addition, any enhancements to our platform could involve research and development processes that are more complex, expensive and time-consuming than we anticipate. we may experience unanticipated delays in the availability of enhancements to our platform and may fail to meet customer expectations with respect to the timing of such availability. if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing and releasing updates to our platform on a timely basis that can adequately respond to advanced threats and our customers’ evolving needs, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and our reputation as a leading provider of endpoint and platform security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to develop additional features for our platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions, our marketing efforts, and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. under certain circumstances, our employees may have access to our customers’ platforms. an employee may take advantage of such access to conduct malicious activities. any such misuse of our platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and operating results. in addition, independent industry and research firms often evaluate our solutions and provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or research firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. moreover, the performance of our channel partners and alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed. substantially all of our sales are fulfilled through our channel partners, including resellers, distributors, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms, and we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from channel partners for the foreseeable future. our agreements with our channel partners are non-exclusive, do not last for set terms, and may be terminated by either party at any time. further, channel partners fulfill our sales on a purchase order basis and do not impose minimum purchase requirements or related terms on sales. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. to the extent our partners are unsuccessful in selling our platform, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high-quality partners in each of the regions in which we sell or plan to sell our platform, we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our platform, or our partners shift focus to other vendors and/or our competitors, our ability to sell our platform and operating results will be harmed. the termination of our relationship with any significant partner may adversely affect our sales and operating results. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our ability to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform. we are also exposed to credit and liquidity risks and our operating results will be harmed if our partners were to become unable or unwilling to pay us at all or in a timely manner, terminate their relationships with us or go out of business. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate such risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our risks. if we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. if partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these partners, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. our partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners. in such instances, we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity, and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited. we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners, as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible, which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could adversely affect our business and operating results. our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable and subject to budgetary uncertainty. we have made significant investments to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. although we anticipate that they may increase in the future, sales to governmental organizations have not accounted for, and may never account for, a significant portion of our revenue. sales to governmental organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely affect our business and operating results, including the following risks: selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale; government certification, software supply chain or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our platform may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the governmental sector until we have attained the revised certification or meet other new requirements. for example, although we are currently fedramp authorized, such authorization is costly to maintain and subject to rigorous compliance and if we lose our authorization, it will restrict our ability to sell to government customers; government demand and payment for our platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our platform, including as a result of sudden, unforeseen and disruptive events such as government shutdowns, governmental defaults on indebtedness, war, regional geopolitical conflicts around the world, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics; governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and operating results, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if an investigation, audit, or other review, were to uncover improper or illegal activities; governments may require certain products to be manufactured, produced, hosted or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost locations, and we may not produce or host all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies; and refusal to grant certain certifications or clearance by one government agency, or decision by one government agency that our products do not meet certain standards, may cause reputational harm and cause concern with other government agencies. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governmental organizations to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results. our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sale of our platform to customers located outside of the us and our current, and any further, expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are generating a growing portion of our revenue outside of the us, and conduct our business activities in various foreign countries, including some emerging markets where we have limited experience, where the challenges of conducting our business can be significantly different from those we have faced in more developed markets and where business practices may create internal control risks including: fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could add volatility to our operating results; new, or changes in, regulatory requirements; tariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures; exposure to numerous, increasing, stringent (particularly in the eu), and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security; costs of localizing products and services (including, but not limited to data localization requirements); lack of acceptance of localized products and services; the need to make significant investments in people, solutions and infrastructure, typically well in advance of revenue generation; challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs; difficulties in maintaining our corporate culture with a dispersed and distant workforce; treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and other potential tax issues, including with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements; different or weaker protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property; economic weakness or currency-related crises; compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, data privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur and regulations applicable to us and our third party data providers from whom we purchase and resell syndicated data; vetting and monitoring our third-party channel partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures; the lack of reference customers and other marketing assets in regional markets that are new or developing for us, as well as other adaptations in our market generation efforts that we may be slow to identify and implement; dependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics, including the armed conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan; actual or perceived instability in the global banking system; cybersecurity incidents; corporate espionage; and political instability and security risks in the countries where we are doing business and changes in the public perception of governments in the countries where we operate or plan to operate. we have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, additional corporate operating restructurings from time to time that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad. we consider various factors in evaluating these restructurings, including the alignment of our corporate legal entity structure with our organizational structure and its objectives, the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure, and the long-term cash flows and cash needs of our business. such restructurings increase our operating costs, and if ineffectual, could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate. we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage our future growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and we expect to continue to invest broadly across our organization to support our growth. for example, our headcount grew from over 2,100 employees as of january 31, 2023, to over 2,300 employees as of january 31, 2024. although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not sustain our growth rates, nor can we assure you that our investments to support our growth will be successful. the growth and expansion of our business will require us to invest significant financial and operational resources and the continuous dedication of our management team. in addition, as we have grown, our number of customers has also increased significantly, and we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our platform in more complex computing environments. the rapid growth and expansion of our business places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, in june 2023, we approved a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce and operations with current business needs, priorities, and near-term growth expectations. if we continue to experience rapid growth, we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. for example, as we grow, we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. as we grow, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. any future growth will continue to add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, cause difficulty or delays in deploying new customers, reduce demand for our platform, cause difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our platform, particularly with respect to large organizations and government entities. for example, in light of current macroeconomic conditions, we have observed a lengthening of the sales cycle for some prospective customers that we attribute to higher cost-consciousness around it budgets, which has become more pronounced recently. customers often view the subscription to our platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens our sales cycle. our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the sales prices of our platform may decrease, or the mix of our sales may change, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform. as the market for endpoint security matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that are similar to or compete with ours, we may be unable to effectively optimize our prices through increases or decreases, attract new customers at our offered prices or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. further, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services. this could lead customers to demand greater price concessions or additional functionality at the same price levels. as a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or provide more features without corresponding increases in price, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the term of their subscription, which is generally one to three years. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decrease in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide partial refunds or our customers could be entitled to terminate their contracts and our business would suffer. certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability of our platform and our support services. failure of or disruption to our infrastructure or third-party hosting service providers could impact the performance of our platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with credit, partial refunds or termination rights. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheets for such commitments. our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our platform will harm our business and operating results. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the us or other countries. the sale and support of our platform also entails the risk of product liability claims. we employ measures in the form of policy and technical controls to limit unauthorized access to our platform by our employees, customers and third parties, however, these measures may not fully or effectively protect our platform from unauthorized access. additionally, we typically provide indemnification to customers, partners or other third parties we do business with for certain losses suffered or expenses incurred as a result of third-party claims arising from our infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. we also provide unlimited liability for certain breaches of confidentiality, as defined in our master subscription agreement. we also provide limited liability in the event of certain breaches of our master subscription agreement. certain of these contractual provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. however, as we continue to grow, indemnification claims against us for the obligations listed may increase. when our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our platform, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or in certain limited circumstances, other claims, would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. additionally, our platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover the claims asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we have offered some of our customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have remediated warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering warranties which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, although the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control (ofac), list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise subject to us sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions, in violation of our warranty and applicable law. key business metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and to change as our business evolves, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected by real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics or any changes in metrics we disclose. we regularly review key business metrics, including our arr, number of customers with arr of $100,000, nrr, and other measures to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. these key metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement at the time of reporting, there are inherent challenges in such measurements. if we fail to maintain effective processes and systems, our key metrics calculations may be inaccurate, and we may not be able to identify those inaccuracies. we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we make adjustments to improve their accuracy. moreover, we may periodically change the definition or methodology underlying our key metrics. for example, as a result of a decline in usage and consumption in the quarter ended april 30, 2023, we decided to change our methodology of calculating arr for consumption and usage-based agreements to reflect committed contract values as opposed to based on consumption and usage. in addition, as part of our quarterly review of arr in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended april 30, 2023, we discovered some historical inaccuracies relating to arr on certain contracts, which we have corrected. as a result, we made a one-time adjustment of approximately 5% of total arr, which we reflected in our total arr as of april 30, 2023. if our key metrics are inaccurate or if investors perceive any changes to our key business metrics or the methodologies for calculating these metrics negatively, our business could be adversely affected. risks related to our people we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. the loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team or members of our board of directors, as well as certain of our key marketing, sales, finance, support, product development, people team, or technology personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of tomer weingarten, our co-founder, chairman of the board of directors, president, and chief executive officer, who is critical to the development of our technology, platform, future vision, and strategic direction. from time to time, there have been and may in the future be changes in our management team. while we seek to manage any such transitions carefully, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge, cause disruptions to our business and negatively affect our business. further, we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in israel which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our workforce and we have implemented continuity measures to address the safety of our employees and continue our operations in the event of reduced employee availability in the conflict region. however, if our continuity measures fail or the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations. competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, especially in the san francisco bay area, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. more generally, the technology industry, and the cybersecurity industry more specifically, is also subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and related services. moreover, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. we have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. we may be required to provide more training to our personnel than we currently anticipate. further, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, overall macroeconomics and workforce participation rates. should our competitors recruit our employees, our level of expertise and ability to execute our business plan would be negatively impacted. in june 2023, we approved a restructuring plan, which impacted approximately 5% of our workforce. this reduction may adversely impact our ability to achieve our future operational targets. in the future, we may be unable to hire qualified employees and may be unable to successfully train those employees that we are able to hire, and as a result, employees may not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected or at all. further, the reduction could yield unanticipated consequences or disruptions in our day-to-day operations, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions. additionally, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may also negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. changes in us immigration and work authorization laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. our business may be adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes. moreover, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team, sales team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards and other compensation they receive in connection with their employment. if the perceived value of our compensatory package declines, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. further, our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. in recent years, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key employees, these agreements are on an “at-will” basis, meaning they are able to terminate their employment with us at any time. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. if we do not effectively integrate, train, manage, and retain sales personnel, and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may be unable to increase our customer base and increase sales to our existing customers. our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to expand our sales and marketing operations. we have and plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs and to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to target additional potential customers, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting and maintaining additional customers. if we are unable to find efficient ways to deploy our sales and marketing investments or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our business and operating results would be adversely affected. furthermore, we plan to continue expanding our sales force and there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our success in hiring, integrating, training, managing, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth, particularly in international markets. new hires require significant training and may take extended time before they are productive. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, or at all, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. moreover, our international expansion may be slow or unsuccessful if we are unable to retain qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets which we target. if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, manage, and retain a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. any inability to maintain a high-quality customer support organization could lead to a lack of customer satisfaction, which could hurt our customer relationships and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. once our platform is deployed within our customers’ computing environments, our customers rely on our technical support services to assist with service customization and optimization and to resolve certain issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our platform and advanced services. if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our platform, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services as part of our platform to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our product and business reputation and on positive recommendations, referrals, and peer promotions from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial condition. we believe that our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed. we believe that our corporate culture has been, and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. if we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, inclusion, creativity, and teamwork that we believe is important to support our growth. as we implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively impact our future success. we are also taking steps to develop a more inclusive and diverse workforce, however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"risks related to our intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us. we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, and confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our technology. valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or platform. any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. patent applications in the us are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. in addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the us may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications. such changes may lead to uncertainties or increased costs and risks surrounding the prosecution, validity, ownership, enforcement, and defense of our issued patents and patent applications and other intellectual property, the outcome of third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property brought against us and the actual or enhanced damages (including treble damages) that may be awarded in connection with any such current or future claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. however, such agreements may not be enforceable in full or in part in all jurisdictions and any breach could negatively affect our business and our remedy for such breach may be limited. the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. lastly, the measures we employ to limit the access and distribution of our proprietary information may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property. as such, we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. policing unauthorized use of our technology or platform is difficult. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the us. for example, many foreign countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. effective trade secret protection may also not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have employees or independent contractors. the loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality. in addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and employment laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. from time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. moreover, the availability of copyright protection and other legal protections for intellectual property generated by certain technologies, such as generative ai, is uncertain. the use of generative ai and other forms of ai may expose us to risks because the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other ai output, has not been fully interpreted by us courts or been fully addressed by us federal or state regulation, as well as in foreign jurisdictions. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and platform protected other than by patent rights), we will find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create our platform and other innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. third parties have claimed and may claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our current or future products and services infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may result in legal claims against our channel partners, our alliance partners, our customers and us. these claims may damage our brand and reputation, harm our customer relationships, and create liability for us. contractually, we are expected to indemnify our partners and customers for these types of claims. we expect the number of such claims to increase as the number of products and services and the level of competition in our market grows, as the functionality of our platform overlaps with that of other products and services, and as the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase. we generally agree in our customer and partner contracts to indemnify customers for certain expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third-party intellectual property infringement claims associated with our platform. to the extent that any claim arises as a result of third-party technology we have licensed for use in our platform, we may be unable to recover from the appropriate third party any expenses or other liabilities that we incur. companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. furthermore, patent holding companies, non-practicing entities, and other adverse patent owners that are not deterred by our existing intellectual property protections may seek to assert patent claims against us. from time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have invited us to license their patents and may, in the future, assert patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, our alliance partners, or our customers. we have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. there may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and assets. we may also face exposure to third-party intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation actions if we engage software engineers or other personnel who were previously engaged by competitors or other third parties and those personnel inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of third parties into our products. in addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market, and support potential products or enhancements, which could severely harm our business. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate, and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. these claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, and may require us to indemnify our customers for liabilities they incur as a result of such claims. these claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. we might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. alternatively, we could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort, and expense, and may affect the performance or features of our platform. if we cannot license or develop alternative non-infringing substitutes for any infringing technology used in any aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our"
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"platform and may be unable to compete effectively. any of these results would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business. we currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. licensing technologies from third parties exposes us to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement and vulnerabilities due to, among other things, our lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the care taken to safeguard against risks. we cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our platform. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business, including our financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner, or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. third-party software we rely on may be updated infrequently, unsupported or subject to vulnerabilities that may not be resolved in a timely manner, any of which may expose our solutions to vulnerabilities. as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation. our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code, which they are not typically required to maintain and update, and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. although we monitor our use of open source software in an effort both to comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses and to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available as source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon our use and distribution of the open source software. if we combine and distribute our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release combined the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solution, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our platform, and reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims, regardless of validity, could result in time consuming and costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention away from developing the business, expose us to customer indemnity claims, or force us to disclose source code. litigation could be costly for us to defend, result in paying damages, entering into unfavorable licenses, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or cause delays by requiring us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solution."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"risks related to legal and regulatory matters we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in our markets. our platform and related technology are subject to us export controls, including the us department of commerce’s export administration regulations (also known as “ear”), and we and our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties are also subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by ofac and other us government agencies. we incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our platform, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the us only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. we also offer certain customers a ransomware warranty in addition to their subscriptions, providing coverage in the form of a limited monetary payment if they are affected by a ransomware attack (as specified in our ransomware warranty agreement), and though the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise prohibited to receive such payments under us sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions in violation of our warranty and applicable law. furthermore, us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export and re-export of certain hardware and software and the provision of certain cloud-based solutions to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by us sanctions and for certain end-uses. as an example, following russia’s invasion of ukraine, the us and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against russia and belarus. the us and its allies could expand and strengthen these sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. these restrictions would further impact our ability to do business in certain parts of the world and to do business with certain persons and entities, including selling our services and using local developers. we also collect information about cyber threats from open sources, intermediaries and third parties that we make available to our customers in our threat industry publications. further, regulators in the us and elsewhere have signaled an increased emphasis on sanctions and export control enforcement, including several recent high-profile enforcement actions and increased pressure for companies to self-disclose potential violations. while we have implemented certain procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the collection and distribution of this information, we cannot assure you that these procedures have been effective or that we, or third parties who we do not control, have complied with all laws or regulations in this regard. failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the collection and distribution of this information also could have negative consequences to us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties. although we take precautions to prevent our information collection practices and services from being provided in violation of such laws, our information collection practices and services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws. if we or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets or otherwise. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries. additionally, export restrictions imposed on russia and belarus specifically limit the export of encryption hardware, software and related source code and technology to these locations which could limit our ability to provide our software and services to these countries. changes in our platform, and changes in or promulgation of new export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 (fcpa), as amended, the united kingdom bribery act 2010 (the bribery act), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the us and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the public, and in certain cases, private sector. we leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents and channel partners, to conduct our business in the us and abroad, to sell subscriptions to our platform and to collect information about cyber threats. we and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries and other third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with fcpa, bribery act and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries or other third parties have not taken, or will not take actions, in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we increase our international sales and business, including our business with government organizations, our risks under these laws may increase. noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from us government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. any investigations, actions or sanctions could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, the rapid evolution of ai, including potential government regulation of ai, may require significant additional resources to develop, test, and maintain our platform. our ai-related initiatives may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, including regarding the use of ai in our products and the marketing of products using ai, litigation, customer reporting or documentation requirements, ethical or social concerns, or other complications and may also introduce risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy, and security and data provenance. for example, the european commission’s proposed artificial intelligence act could also impose new obligations or limitations affecting our business, if and when it enters into force. if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. we receive, store, and process personal information from our employees, customers, the employees of our customers, and our end users. this personal information is hosted by our third-party service providers. a wide variety of state, national, and international laws, as well as regulations and industry standards apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information and other information, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent across countries or conflict with other rules. data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. failure to comply with laws, regulations and industry standards regarding personal information or other information could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems, and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. in the us, there are numerous federal and state consumer, privacy, and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information, including security breach notification laws and consumer protection laws. each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and constantly evolving. notably, but not necessarily limited to, we may be subject to: controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (also known as the “can-spam act”) and similar state consumer protection laws regarding the use of telephones and text messaging for marketing purposes. section 5(a) of the federal trade commission (ftc) act for violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, resulting in a finding of an unfair act or practice. the ccpa, effective since january 1, 2020, which created new data privacy obligations for covered businesses and provided new privacy rights to california residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. a ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act (cpra) went into force july 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the ccpa, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal data. the cpra also creates a new state agency, known as the california privacy protection agency, which is vested with the authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra. potential uncertainty surrounding the ccpa and cpra may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, particularly in the event of a data breach, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. other states have enacted consumer privacy laws comparable to the ccpa that came into effect in 2023: virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act which became effective january 1, 2023; colorado and connecticut enacted the colorado privacy act and the connecticut personal data privacy and online monitoring act, which both became effective july 1, 2023; utah enacted the utah consumer privacy act, which became effective december 31, 2023. in addition, as of december 31, 2023, eight other states (delaware, indiana, iowa, florida, montana, oregon, tennessee and texas) enacted privacy legislation which will become effective between july 1, 2024 and january 1, 2026. numerous other states also have pending consumer privacy legislation under review, which if enacted, would add additional costs and expense of resources to maintain compliance. in certain circumstances, we may also be subject to the gdpr (established in 2018 and implemented by countries in the eea) and the uk gdpr, which respectively govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of natural persons, and it applies extra-territorially and imposes onerous requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours). companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global turnover of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. additionally, following the withdrawal by the uk from the eu and the eea, companies must comply with both the gdpr and the uk gdpr as incorporated into uk national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global annual turnover. in addition to the foregoing, a breach of the gdpr or uk gdpr could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). we may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. the gdpr and uk gdpr requires, among other things, that personal data only be transferred outside of the eea, or the uk, respectively to jurisdictions that have been deemed adequate (also known as “third countries,”) by the european commission or by the uk data protection regulator, respectively. accordingly, personal data may not be transferred to those jurisdictions that have not been deemed adequate, unless steps are taken to legitimize those data transfers. switzerland follows similar legal practices. we rely on the use of standard contractual clauses (sccs), a standard form of contract approved by the european commission, as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism for the transfer of personal data to third countries; however, the sccs may not be alone sufficient to protect data transferred to the us or other third countries under certain circumstances without making a case-by-case basis assessment of the legal regime applicable in the destination country according to the cjeu. on june 28, 2021, the european commission issued an adequacy decision for personal data transfers from the eea to the uk, with a sunset clause of four years, meaning that the european commission will review and renew only if the european commission considers that the uk continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection. notably, the european commission reserved a right to intervene at any time during the four-year adequacy period if the uk deviates from the level of protection then in place. if this adequacy decision is reversed by the european commission, we would have to implement protection measures such as the sccs for personal data transfers between the eu and the uk or find alternative solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data from the eu into the uk in march 2022, the uk information commissioner’s office adopted an international data transfer agreement (idta) for transfers of personal data out of the uk to so-called third countries, as well as an international data transfer addendum (uk scc addendum) that can be used with the sccs for the same purpose. to add to this complexity, effective on july 10, 2023, the european commission adopted the new eu-us data privacy framework (dpf) which allows for transfers of personal data from the eu to certified companies in the us without the need for additional privacy safeguards as an alternative to the sccs. in october 2023, a uk extension to the dpf (the uk – us data bridge) was adopted enabling the transfer of personal data between the uk and us entities without the need for an idta or uk scc addendum. however, the dpf and the uk – us data bridge could be subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the eu and the uk to the us to become uncertain once again. some countries (including some outside the eea) also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services if we were to operate in those countries. if we are required to implement additional measures to transfer data from the eea, this could increase our compliance costs, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the myriad of international and us privacy and data breach laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. in many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising. in addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. as supervisory authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal information transfers (including regarding data export and circumstances in which we cannot use the sccs), we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines. if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, adversely affecting our financial results, and possibly making it necessary to establish localized storage systems in the eea, switzerland, and the uk to maintain personal data originating from those jurisdictions that adds expenses and may create distractions from our other business pursuits. loss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose"
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims. we are also subject to evolving eu and uk privacy laws on cookies and electronic marketing. in the eu and the uk, informed opt-in consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. the gdpr also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. while we anticipate the development of the eprivacy regulation to govern cookies and e-marketing, recent european court decisions and regulators’ guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. if regulators start to enforce the strict approach in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. regulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand users. similar concerns may happen under the new cpra regime in california and other current and soon-to-be enacted us state privacy laws. additionally, by expanding into the eu and uk, we may also trigger article 3(2) of the gdpr/uk gdpr directly as we may be considered to be monitoring data subjects. to the extent we process personal data on behalf of our customers for the provision of services, we have, and may in the future, also be required to enter into data processing agreements which comply with article 28 of the gdpr/uk gdpr. we depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process personal data on our behalf or as our sub-processor. to the extent required by applicable law, we attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using third parties by performing security assessments and detailed due diligence, entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that providers only process personal data according to our instructions or comparable instructions to the instructions of our customer (as applicable), and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. there is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. any violation of privacy, data protection, data or cybersecurity laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties under the gdpr and the uk gdpr outlined above. in recent years, some regulators have proposed or introduced cybersecurity licensing requirements or certification regimes for specific sectors, such as critical infrastructure. these may impose new requirements on us or our current or prospective customer including, but not limited to, data processing locations, breach notification, and security standards. such requirements may cause us to incur significant organizational costs and increase barriers of entry into new markets. new worldwide data protection laws, including in the us and european jurisdictions described above, may lead to changing definitions of personal information and other sensitive information which may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. notably some foreign jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these respective jurisdictions. our failure to comply with applicable laws, directives, and regulations may result in enforcement action against us, including fines, and damage to our reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. any failure or perceived failure by us, even if unfounded, to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to customers, users or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, penalties, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. for example, in 2017, we reached a consent agreement with the ftc, to resolve an investigation relating to certain disclosures in our privacy policy. the consent agreement requires us, among other things, to provide information to the ftc about our compliance with the ftc order and about representations made in our marketing materials. we may be subject to future investigations and legal proceedings by the ftc or other regulators. as such, it is possible that a regulatory inquiry might result in changes to our policies or business practices. violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, it is possible that future orders issued by, or enforcement actions initiated by, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of our customers’ data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained – or in how these applicable laws, regulations or industry practices are interpreted and enforced by state, federal and international privacy regulators – could require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and fines, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features that make use of the data that our customers voluntarily share with us. any security breach or incident, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus, malware, ransomware, denial of service, credential stuffing attack, supply chain attack, hacking or similar breach involving our networks and systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, could result in the loss of customer data, including personal information, disruption to our operations, significant remediation costs, lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. these attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations, and security breaches and incidents may arise from other sources, such as employee or contractor error or malfeasance. cyber threats are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. as a cybersecurity company, we have been and may continue to be specifically targeted by malicious actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. our industry is experiencing an increase in phishing attacks and unauthorized scans of systems searching for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to exploit. if our security measures are breached or otherwise compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, defect, vulnerability or bug in our products or products of third parties upon which we rely, malfeasance or otherwise, including any such breach or compromise resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our confidential information, including personal information or the personal information of our customers or others, or if any of these are perceived or reported to occur, we may suffer the loss, compromise, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of our or others’ confidential information and personal information, we may face a loss in intellectual property protection, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could be subject to claims, demands, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, indemnity obligations, and otherwise incur significant liability. even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident or breach, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to any security breach or incident. techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. we and our third-party vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with the conflicts in ukraine, the middle east and tensions between china and taiwan, we and our third-party vendors and service providers are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches from nation-state and affiliated actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our and our third-party vendors’ and service providers’ systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our products and services as well as retaliatory cybersecurity attacks from russian and russian-affiliated actors against companies with a us presence. in addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the us and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. we may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain. we and our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security measures and increased risk of suffering cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks. should we or the third-party vendors and service providers upon which we rely experience such attacks, including from ransomware or other security breaches or incidents, our operations may also be hindered or interrupted due to system disruptions or otherwise, with foreseeable secondary contractual, regulatory, financial and reputational harms that may arise from such an incident. further, we cannot assure that any limitations of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security incident. we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. if our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information, whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the ftc or applicable state attorneys general. our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions, and costly litigation (including class actions). any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are currently in, and may in the future, become involved in litigation that may adversely affect us. from time to time, we have been subject to claims, suits and other proceedings. for example, we are currently the subject of securities litigation and commercial litigation. for additional information regarding these litigation matters, see the section titled “legal proceedings.” regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"risks related to financial and accounting matters the requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, result in significant costs and may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. as a public company we incur and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the new york stock exchange (nyse). we expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our consolidated financial statements and in the reports that we will file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired companies may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results, may result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our class a common stock. our management is also required, pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance (esg)-focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. we have incurred significant costs with respect to our directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage. in the future, it may be more expensive or more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. these factors would also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. being a public company requires significant resources and management oversight. as a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"we could be subject to additional tax liabilities and us federal and global income tax reform could adversely affect us. we are subject to us federal, state, local and sales taxes in the us and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. in addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws in the us or in other jurisdictions in which we operate. for example, the us tax law legislation, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, significantly reformed the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the internal revenue code), reducing us federal tax rates, making sweeping changes to rules governing international business operations, and imposing significant additional limitations on tax benefits, including the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating loss carryforwards. on august 16, 2022, president biden signed the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) into law. the ira contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on certain corporate stock buy-backs taking place after december 31, 2022. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) inclusive framework of 137 jurisdictions have joined a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation rules. the first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between countries for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with global turnover above €20 billion. the second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent applicable to in-scope multinational enterprises and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with annual consolidated group revenue in excess of €750 million. we are still evaluating the impact of the pillar two rules as they continue to be refined by the oecd and implemented by various national governments. however, it is possible that the pillar two rules, as implemented by various national governments, could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $721.2 million and $390.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for us income tax purposes. if not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. in addition, as of january 31, 2024, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $5.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2037, and state research and development credit carryforwards of $2.9 million, which do not expire. we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $202.8 million, as of january 31, 2024, which do not expire. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that certain of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. similar rules apply under us state tax laws. we have, and may in the future, experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change us net operating loss carryforwards to offset us federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. we could be required to collect additional sales, use, value added, digital services, or other similar taxes or be subject to other liabilities with respect to past or future sales, that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our solutions and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we do not collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, value added, digital services, or assert other tax collection obligations on us that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. further, an increasing number of us states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. a successful assertion by one or more us states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as interest and penalties. furthermore, certain jurisdictions, such as the uk, france and canada, have enacted a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering enacting similar laws. a successful assertion by a us state or local government, or other country or jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, value added, digital services or other similar taxes could, among other things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage potential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any such sales or other related taxes, or otherwise harm our business. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our operating results and financial condition. we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business and growth in international markets. we generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets, and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. furthermore, increases in tax rates, new or revised tax laws, and new interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, could result in an increase in our overall tax obligations which could adversely affect our business. our intercompany relationships and intercompany transactions are subject to complex transfer pricing rules administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate with potentially divergent tax laws. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions will depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the us, to our intercompany transactions, international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. it is not uncommon for tax authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, the transfer pricing and charges for intercompany services and other intercompany transactions, or with respect to the valuation of our intellectual property and the manner in which our intellectual property is utilized within our group. in 2022, we began negotiating a bilateral advance pricing agreement (apa) with the us and the israeli governments, covering various transfer pricing matters for intercompany transactions relating to the intergroup utilization of our intellectual property among our group enterprises. an apa, if obtained, will provide us with a more predictable future business operating model, and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making certain transfer pricing adjustments within the scope of these agreements. these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. if taxing authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international operations were to successfully challenge our transfer pricing, we could be required to reallocate part or all of our income to reflect transfer pricing adjustments, which could result in an increased tax liability to us. in such circumstances, if the country from where the income was reallocated did not agree to the reallocation, we could become subject to tax on the same income in both countries, resulting in double taxation. furthermore, the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. we believe that our tax and financial accounting positions are reasonable and our tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liability. we also believe that our assumptions, judgements, and estimates are reasonable and that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions are on arm’s-length terms. however, the relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions, including any assumptions, judgements or estimates used for these transfer pricing matters and intercompany transactions. if any of these tax authorities determine that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions do not meet arm’s-length criteria, and were successful in challenging our positions, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties related thereto, which could be in excess of any reserves established therefore, and which could result in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, including in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and such jurisdictions may assess new or additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our operating results could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to those related to stock-based compensation, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, useful lives of long-lived assets and intangibles, the valuation of intangibles acquired as part of a business combination, and accounting for income taxes. our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a potential decline in the market price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. for example, sec proposals on climate-related disclosures may require us to update our accounting or operational policies, processes, or systems to reflect new or amended financial reporting standards. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may adversely affect our financial results. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, strengthening of the us dollar increases the real cost of our platform to our customers outside of the us, which could lead to delays in the purchase of our platform and the lengthening of our sales cycle. if the us dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, increased international sales in the future, including through continued international expansion, our channel partners and other partnerships, could result in foreign currency denominated sales, which would increase our foreign currency risk. our operating expenses incurred outside the us and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations but may do so, or use other derivative instruments, in the future. we may require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, and any inability to generate or obtain such capital may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in order to support our growth and respond to business challenges, such as developing new features or enhancements to our platform to stay competitive, acquiring new technologies, and improving our infrastructure, we have made significant financial investments in our business and we intend to continue to make such investments. as a result, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to provide the funds required for these investments and other business endeavors. if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to those of holders of our class a common stock. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. if we obtain additional funds through debt financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us. further, the current global macroeconomic environment may make it more difficult to raise additional capital on favorable terms, it at all. such terms may involve restrictive covenants making it difficult to engage in capital raising activities and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. the trading prices of technology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the conflict in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, inflation, interest rate volatility, actual or perceived instability in the banking system, and market downturns, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. in addition, a recession, depression, or other sustained adverse market event could adversely affect our business and the value of our class a common stock. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be adversely affected, requiring us to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our operations."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. our class a common stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; the overall performance of the stock market or technology companies; the number of shares of our class a common stock publicly owned and available for trading; failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; litigation or other proceedings involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; any major changes in our management or our board of directors; the global political, economic and macroeconomic climate, including but not limited to, actual or perceived instability in the banking industry, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, potential recession, inflation, and rising interest rates; other events or factors, including those resulting from war, armed conflict, including the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and cybersecurity incidents. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies, particularly during the current period of global macroeconomic uncertainty, including rising inflation, increasing interest rates, labor shortages and fluctuations in international currency rates, as well as the impacts of regional geopolitical conflicts, including the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan. these economic, political, regulatory and market conditions have and may continue to negatively impact the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock into the public market, including shares of class a common stock held by our existing stockholders that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. in addition, pursuant to our amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, dated october 28, 2020, certain stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file a registration statement for the public resale of such capital stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline or be volatile. we may also issue our shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, an investment, or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the holders of our class b common stock who held, in the aggregate, approximately 72% of the voting power of our capital stock as of january 31, 2024, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. our class b common stock has 20 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. as of january 31, 2024, the holders of our outstanding class b common stock held approximately 72% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock, the holders of our class b common stock collectively are expected to continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of class b common stock, (ii) seven years from the date of our prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to rule 424(b)(4) under the securities act (the final prospectus), or june 29, 2028, (iii) the first date following the completion of our ipo on which the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) held by tomer weingarten, including certain permitted entities that mr. weingarten controls, is less than 25% of the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) that mr. weingarten originally held as of the date of our final prospectus, (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors, following the first date following the completion of our ipo when mr. weingarten is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, consultant or member of our board of directors, (v) the date fixed by our board of directors following the date on which, if applicable, mr. weingarten is terminated for cause, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, and (vi) the date that is 12 months after the death or disability, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, of mr. weingarten. this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. in addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. future transfers by holders of our class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of our class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. the dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our class a common stock. we cannot predict whether our dual class structure will, over time, result in a lower or more volatile market price of our class a common stock, adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. certain stock index providers exclude or limit the ability of multi-class share structures from being added to certain indices. in addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. as a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, may discourage such indices from selecting us for inclusion (notwithstanding our automatic termination provision) may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our class a common stock. any exclusion from certain stock indices could result in less demand for our class a common stock. any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our class a common stock."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"general risk factors we may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as war and regional geopolitical conflicts around the world, that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could have an adverse effect on us. our business operations are also subject to interruption by fire, power shortages, flooding, and other events beyond our control. in addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. further, acts of war, armed conflict, terrorism and other geopolitical unrest, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in israel which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our business results of operations and we have implemented continuity measures to address the safety of our employees and continue our operations in the event of reduced employee availability in the conflict region. however, if our continuity measures fail or the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations. in the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, cyberattack, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in development of our platform, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of such natural disasters. moreover, any of our office locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our corporate offices are located in california, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, heatwaves, and droughts. these events can, in turn, have impacts on inflation risk, food security, water security and on our employees’ health and well-being. additionally, all the aforementioned risks will be further increased if we do not implement an effective disaster recovery plan or our partners’ disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate."
S,2024-03-27,risk factors,"investors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. there is an increasing focus from certain regulators, investors, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to esg matters both in the us and internationally. some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. we may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the esg standards set by various constituencies. further, esg initiatives, goals or commitments could be difficult to achieve or costly to implement. if our competitors’ corporate social responsibility performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. moreover, california recently adopted two new climate-related bills, which require companies doing business in california that meet certain revenue thresholds to publicly disclose certain greenhouse gas emissions data and climate-related financial risk reports, and compliance with such requirements could require significant effort and resources. additionally, in march 2024, the sec enacted comprehensive climate change disclosure rules, which have since been challenged by various third parties. our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities and our related disclosures, including from the investment community, and our failure to achieve progress or manage the dynamic public sentiment and legal landscape in these areas on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial performance. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our class a common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our class a common stock or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. we are currently subject to and can in the future be subject to securities class action litigation. securities class action litigation can be instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. we are currently subject to securities litigation as further described in the section titled “legal proceedings.” this type of litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may make it more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in the future and may require us to opt for lower overall policy limits and coverage or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs, or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. these factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or other change of control of the company that the stockholders may consider favorable. in addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that: provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; provide that only our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; do not provide for cumulative voting; provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders; provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our class b common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. moreover, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (dgcl), may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation contains exclusive forum provisions for certain claims, which may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. moreover, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the us will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act (federal forum provision). our decision to adopt a federal forum provision followed a decision by the supreme court of the state of delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under delaware law. while there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the delaware supreme court or determine that the federal forum provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the federal forum provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder. in addition, the federal forum provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act. accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the federal forum provision. these provisions may limit a stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results."
S,2024-03-27,managements discussion,"item 7. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading “special note about forward-looking statements” in this annual report on form 10-k. you should review the disclosure under the heading “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. our fiscal year ends on january 31, and our fiscal quarters end on april 30, july 31, october 31, and january 31. our fiscal years ended january 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are referred to herein as fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “sentinelone,” the “company,” “we” “our” “us,” or similar terms refer to sentinelone, inc. and its subsidiaries. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2023 filed with the sec on march 29, 2023. overview we founded sentinelone in 2013 with a dramatically new approach to cybersecurity. we pioneered the world’s first purpose-built ai-powered extended detection and response (xdr) platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous, from the endpoint and beyond. our singularity platform instantly defends against cyberattacks — performing at a faster speed, greater scale, and higher accuracy than otherwise possible from a human-powered approach. our singularity platform ingests, correlates, and queries petabytes of structured and unstructured data from a myriad of ever-expanding disparate external and internal sources in real-time. we build rich context and deliver greater visibility by constructing a dynamic representation of data across an organization. as a result, our ai models are highly accurate, actionable, and autonomous. our distributed ai models run both locally on every endpoint and every cloud workload, as well as on our cloud platform. our static and vector-agnostic behavioral ai models, which run on the endpoints themselves, provide our customers with protection even when their devices are not connected to the cloud. in the cloud, our streaming ai detects anomalies that surface when multiple data feeds are correlated. by providing full visibility into the storyline of every secured device across the organization through one console, our platform makes it very fast for analysts to easily search through petabytes of data to investigate incidents and proactively hunt threats. we have extended our control and visibility planes beyond the traditional endpoint to unmanaged iot devices. our singularity platform can be flexibly deployed on the environments that our customers choose, including public, private, or hybrid clouds. our feature parity across windows, macos, linux, and kubernetes offers best-of-breed protection, visibility, and control across today’s heterogeneous it environments. together, these capabilities make our platform the logical choice for organizations of all sizes, industry verticals, and compliance requirements. our platform offers true multi-tenancy, which enables some of the world’s largest organizations and our managed security providers and incident response partners with an excellent management experience. our customers realize improved cybersecurity outcomes with fewer people. we generate substantially all of our revenue by selling subscriptions to our singularity platform. our subscription tiers include singularity core, singularity control, and singularity complete. we also offer product bundles that include singularity commercial and singularity enterprise. additionally, customers can extend the functionality of our platform through our subscription singularity modules. we generally price our subscriptions and modules on a per agent basis, and each agent generally corresponds with an endpoint, server, virtual machine, or container. our subscription contracts typically range from one to three years. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of a contract. most of our contracts are for terms representing annual increments, therefore contracts generally come up for renewal in the same period in subsequent years. the timing of large multi-year enterprise contracts can create some variability in subscription order levels between periods, though the impact to our revenue in any particular period is limited as a result of ratable revenue recognition. our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving expanded usage of our platform by existing customers. our sales organization is comprised of our enterprise sales, inside sales and customer solutions engineering teams. it leverages our global network of independent software vendors (isvs), alliance partners, and channel partners for prospect access. additionally, our sales teams work closely with our customers, channel partners, and alliance partners to drive adoption of our platform, and our software solutions are fulfilled through our channel partners. our channel partners include some of the world’s largest resellers and distributors, managed service providers (msps), managed security service providers (mssps), managed detection and response providers (mdrs), original equipment manufacturers (oems), and incident response (ir) firms. once customers experience the benefits of our platform, they often upgrade their subscriptions to benefit from the full range of our extended detection and response (xdr), it, and security operations capabilities. additionally, many of our customers adopt singularity modules over time to extend the functionality of our platform and increase their coverage footprint. the combination of platform upgrades and extended modules drives our powerful land-and-expand motion. our singularity platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. we had 1,133 customers with annualized recurring revenue (arr) of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2024, up from 872 customers with arr of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2023. we define arr as the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and consumption and usage-based agreements at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. as of january 31, 2024 and 2023, no single end customer accounted for more than 3% of our arr. our revenue outside of the us represented 36% and 35% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, illustrating the global nature of our solutions. we have grown rapidly since our inception. our revenue was $621.2 million, $422.2 million, and $204.8 million for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 47% and 106%, respectively. during this period, we continued to invest in growing our business to capitalize on our market opportunity. as a result, our net loss for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $338.7 million, $378.7 million, and $271.1 million, respectively. impact of global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. worsening economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate volatility, slower growth, potential recession, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, actual or perceived instability in the global banking industry, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential government shutdowns related thereto, and other changes in economic conditions, and the impact of natural or man-made global events, including wars and other regional geopolitical armed conflict, such as the conflicts in the middle east, ukraine and tensions between china and taiwan, may result in decreased sales productivity and growth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. as a result of the current macroeconomic environment, we have recently experienced certain impacts on our business, including a decline in usage and consumption patterns from certain customers, especially larger enterprise customers, longer sales cycles, and deal downsizing by new customers and of renewals by existing customers, especially larger enterprises. we intend to continue to monitor global macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions to the extent our business begins to be adversely impacted. for example, in june 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the plan) designed to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs and better align our workforce and operations with current business needs, priorities, and near-term growth expectations. the actions associated with the plan are expected to be fully complete by the end of fiscal 2025, subject to finalizing the disposition of certain office space. we incurred approximately $7.4 million in charges in connection with the plan in fiscal 2024, consisting of severance payments and employee benefits, impairment charges related to excess facilities and inventory write-offs, offset partially by savings related to the reversal on stock-based compensation expense. we maintain an office in tel aviv, israel and had approximately 13% of our personnel in israel as of january 31, 2024. we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the armed conflict in the middle east which began in october 2023. while this conflict is still evolving, to date, the conflict has not had an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. however, if the conflict continues to worsen or intensify, any business interruptions or spillover effects could adversely affect our business and operations. we are unable to predict the full impact that macroeconomic or other geopolitical factors will have on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the actions that may be taken by government authorities across the us or other countries, changes in central bank policies and interest rates, rates of inflation, potential uncertainty with respect to the federal debt ceiling and budget and potential, government shutdowns related thereto, regional geopolitical conflicts, the impact to our customers, partners, and suppliers, and other factors described in the section titled “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10-k. key business metrics and non-gaap financial measures we monitor the following key metrics and non-gaap financial measures to help us

S,2024-03-27,managements discussion,"revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our singularity platform. customers can extend the functionality of their subscription to our platform by subscribing to additional singularity modules. subscriptions provide access to hosted software. the nature of our promise to the customer under the subscription is to provide protection for the duration of the contractual term and as such is considered as a series of distinct services. our arrangements may include fixed consideration, variable consideration, or a combination of the two. fixed consideration is recognized over the term of the arrangement or longer if the fixed consideration relates to a material right. variable consideration in these arrangements is typically a function of transaction volume or another usage-based measure. depending upon the structure of a particular arrangement, we i) allocate the variable amount to each distinct service period within the series and recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e. direct allocation), ii) estimate total variable consideration at contract inception (giving consideration to any constraints that may apply and updating the estimates as new information becomes available) and recognizes the total transaction price over the period to which it relates, or iii) apply the ‘right to invoice’ practical expedient and recognize revenue based on the amount invoiced to the customer during the period. premium support and maintenance and other singularity modules are distinct from subscriptions and are recognized ratably over the term as the performance obligations are satisfied. we invoice our customers upfront upon signing for the entire term of the contract, periodically, or in arrears. most of our subscription contracts have a term of one to three years. cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with the hosting and maintenance of our platform. cost of revenue also consists of personnel-related costs associated with our customer support and services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use software, software and subscription services used by our customer support and services team, inventory-related costs, and allocated overhead costs. our third-party cloud infrastructure costs are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of endpoints per customer, the number of modules, and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules. we plan to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure and additional resources in our customer support and services organization as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue from period to period. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. operating expenses also include allocated facilities and it overhead costs. research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. research and development expenses also include consulting fees, software and subscription services, and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform and modules. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase investments in our existing products and services. however, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses. in addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment related expenses, advertising, branding and marketing events, promotions, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and software and subscription services. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third parties that are incremental to obtain a subscription contract. such costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of four years, and any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription are capitalized and amortized over the average contractual term of the renewal. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base, but to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based

S,2024-03-27,managements discussion,"revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. we consider the terms and conditions of contracts with customers and our customary business practices in identifying contracts. we determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, the payment terms for the services can be identified, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and we have determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay. we apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to such customer. our contracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations, which are accounted for separately if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. certain sales arrangements may include variable consideration, which is recorded as part of the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur. business combinations we account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include, but are not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, forecasted revenue, discount rates, and useful lives. management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"item 1a. risk factors investing in our class a common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included before making a decision to invest in our class a common stock. our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our class a common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. summary risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those risks more fully described below. these risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks: risks related to our business and industry ◦we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment. ◦we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"◦we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. ◦our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. ◦adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. ◦a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability, and regulatory exposure, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. ◦defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. ◦existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. ◦if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely affect our customer relationships and overall business. we may not be able to timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to regulatory matters if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share, or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. risks related to our people we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. risks related to our intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us. third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our ipo, including our directors, executive officers, and other beneficial owners who hold in the aggregate approximately 85% of the voting power of our capital stock, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. general risk factors adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risks associated with your investment. we were founded in january 2013 and released our first endpoint security solution in february 2015. our limited operating history and financial data may make it difficult to evaluate our current business, future prospects and other trends. we have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries and sectors, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable or established market. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to fluctuations in our markets or otherwise, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business and operating results would be adversely affected. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future. we have a history of losses, anticipate increases in our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability. if we cannot achieve and sustain profitability, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. we have incurred net losses in all periods since our inception, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we experienced a net loss of $378.7 million and $271.1 million for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of january 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,000.4 million. while we have experienced significant growth in revenue in recent periods, we cannot predict when or whether we will reach or maintain profitability. we also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to drive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers in new geographic locations, which will negatively affect our operating results if our total revenue does not increase. in addition to the anticipated costs to grow our business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a public company. our revenue growth is expected to slow or decline and our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our platform, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities, including acquisitions, new products, services, and feature releases. if we fail to increase our revenue to offset increases in our operating expenses, or manage our costs as we invest in our business, we may not achieve or sustain profitability."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the market for cybersecurity products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and is rapidly evolving, characterized by changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers and by frequent introductions of new or improved products and services. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we would experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our competitors and potential competitors include the following: endpoint security providers, such as crowdstrike and vmware; legacy anti-virus providers such as trellix, symantec, and microsoft; and providers of general network security products and services who offer a broad portfolio of solutions, such as palo alto networks. our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: our ability to attract and retain new customers, expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers; our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate talented employees; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of our customers, including any slowdown in technology spending due to u.s. and global macro-economic issues, including global banking and finance related issues, rising interest rates, overall market downturns, inflation, supply chain disruptions, the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise; changes in customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs; price competition; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or customers and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors; changes in our mix of products, subscriptions and services sold, including changes in the average contract length for subscriptions and support; our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally; changes in the growth rate of endpoint security, cloud security and overall cybersecurity product platform and services sectors; deferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new or enhanced products and services announced by us or our competitors; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our platform; the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses or strategic partnerships; our ability to execute, complete or integrate efficiently any acquisitions that we may undertake; increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate; our ability to increase the size and productivity of our distribution channels; decisions by potential customers to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors; timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, which could increase due to u.s. and global macro-economic issues, including global banking and finance related issues, inflation, rising interest rates, market downturns and the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which would adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our platform, products, and services in a timely manner or at all; the cost and potential outcomes of litigation or other proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and general macroeconomic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including global economic slowdowns, global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, rising interest rates, labor shortages and potential global recession. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do or bundle certain competing products and services at lower prices. our competitors may also have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, customer support and to pursue acquisitions, or they may have other financial, technical, or other resource advantages. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings and more mature distribution and go-to-market strategies, which allows them to leverage their existing customer and distributor relationships to gain business in a manner that discourages potential customers from purchasing our platform. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, including but not limited to increased advancements and proliferation in the use of open artificial intelligence applications, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made or could make acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive products and services than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margin, increased net losses and loss of market share. even if there is significant demand for endpoint and cloud security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we will have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other cybersecurity providers is different and more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of purchasing products and services from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive action with respect to pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. our operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past, and we expect that our operating results will continue to vary significantly in the future such that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. this could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. accordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. fluctuations in quarterly results may negatively impact the trading price of our class a common stock. our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: general economic, macroeconomic and political conditions, both domestic and in our foreign markets, that could impact some or all regions where we operate, including any global economic slowdown, global banking and finance related issues, increased risk of inflation, rising interest rates, labor shortages and potential global recession, war, terrorism or armed conflict, including russia’s invasion of ukraine, or instability in the global system; our ability to attract new and retain existing customers or sell additional features to existing customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers; the timing and length of our sales cycles; changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs; changes in the growth rate of the cybersecurity market generally and market for endpoint security; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors; the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our platform; our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; any disruption in our relationship with isvs, channel partners, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems and ir firms; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solution; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our platform; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes, taxes, regulatory fines or penalties; the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operations, financial results, and liquidity and capital resources, including on customers, sales, expenses, and employees; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices; negative media coverage or publicity; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; and increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in our fourth fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for the reasons described above or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. our platform represents a new approach to endpoint protection and, therefore, it is difficult to predict adoption and demand for our platform. our cloud-native, artificial intelligence-enabled endpoint security platform represents a new approach to endpoint protection. accordingly, it is difficult to predict customer adoption and demand for our platform, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products and services or the success of existing competitive products and services. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with, and customer adoption of, our platform. if the market for our platform does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our software or our services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, implementation challenges for deployment, technological challenges, competing technologies and services, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders and decreased revenue, which would adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. our platform interoperates with, but does not necessarily replace, other security products. businesses that use other cybersecurity products and services may be hesitant to purchase our platform if they believe their existing products and services provide a level of security that is sufficient to meet their needs. if we do not succeed in convincing customers that our platform should be an integral part of their overall approach to security, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. if businesses do not continue to adopt our platform for any of the reasons discussed above or for other reasons not contemplated, our sales would not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. a network or data security incident against us, whether actual, alleged, or perceived, would harm our reputation, create liability and regulatory exposure, and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. companies are subject to an increasing number and wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, ransomware, account takeover, business email compromise, employee fraud, theft or misuse, denial of service attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks that create risks for our internal networks and cloud deployed products and the information they store and process. cybersecurity companies face particularly intense attack efforts, and we have faced, and will continue to face, cyber threats and attacks from a variety of sources. the research that we conduct and report may make us, or our customers, a further target for attacks of all kinds. state-supported and geopolitical-related cyberattacks may increase in connection with russia’s invasion of ukraine and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses. the war in ukraine and associated activities in ukraine and russia has increased the risk of cyberattacks on various types of infrastructure and operations, and the united states government has warned companies to be prepared for a significant increase in russian cyberattacks in response to the sanctions on russia. although we have implemented security measures to prevent such attacks, our networks and systems may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our and/or our customers’ systems, networks, or data. we may face difficulties or delays in identifying or otherwise responding to any attacks or actual or potential security breaches or threats. a breach in our data security or an attack against our platform could impact our networks or the networks and data of our customers that are secured by our platform, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and providing access to malicious parties to information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers, resulting in data being publicly disclosed, misused, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and adversely affect our financial condition. the covid-19 pandemic may have generally increased the attack surface available to criminals, as companies and individuals work online and remotely, which has increased the risk of a successful cyber security attack. we have accordingly increased our investments in protective measures and risk mitigation strategies, but we cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents. protecting our own assets has become more expensive from a dollar investment and time perspective. any actual, alleged or perceived security breach in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. we would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information. for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (ccpa), imposes a private right of action for security breaches that could lead to some form of remedy including regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. where a security incident involves a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alternation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data in respect of which we are a controller or processor under the gdpr and u.k. gdpr (as defined below), this could result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover under the gdpr or £17 million and 4% of total annual revenue in the case of the u.k. gdpr. we may also be required to notify such breaches to regulators and/or individuals which may result in us incurring additional costs. in addition, we may incur significant financial and operational costs to investigate, remediate, eliminate and put in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. any of these negative outcomes could adversely affect the market perception of our platform and customer and investor confidence in our company, and would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our platform, the failure of our platform to block malware or prevent a security breach, misuse of our platform, or risks of product liability claims would harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform and product features are multi-faceted and may be deployed with material defects, software “bugs” or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment to our customers. from time to time, certain of our customers have reported defects in our platform related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. our platform and product features also provide our customers with the ability to customize a multitude of settings, and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure our platform or otherwise fail to configure our products in an optimal manner. such defects and misconfigurations of our platform could cause our platform to operate at suboptimal efficacy, cause it to fail to secure customers’ computing environments and detect and block threats, or temporarily interrupt the functionality of our customers’ endpoints. we also make frequent updates to our platform, which may fail, resulting in temporary vulnerability that increases the likelihood of a material defect. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage target computing environments change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our platform is unable to detect or prevent. furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, our networks, platform, products, including cloud-based technology, and customers could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. in addition, due to the russian invasion there could be a significant increase in russian cyberattacks against our customers, resulting in an increased risk of a security breach of our customers’ systems. in addition, defects or errors in our platform could result in a failure to effectively update customers’ cloud-based products. our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers’ computing environments, leaving their computing environments unprotected against cyber threats. any of these situations could result in negative publicity to us, damage our reputation, and increase expenses and customer relations issues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. advances in computer capabilities, discoveries of new weaknesses and other developments with software generally used by the internet community may increase the risk we will suffer a security breach. furthermore, our platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, ransomware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our platform to reflect industry trends, new technologies and new operating environments, the complexity of the environment of our clients and the sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. our platform may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons. we or our service providers may also suffer security breaches or unauthorized access to personal information, financial account information, and other confidential information due to employee error, rogue employee activity, unauthorized access by third parties acting with malicious intent or who commit an inadvertent mistake or social engineering. if we experience, or our service providers experience, any breaches of security measures or sabotage or otherwise suffer unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, personal information, financial account information or other confidential information, we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to address these problems. we may not be able to remedy any problems caused by hackers or other similar actors in a timely manner, or at all. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our platform does not provide significant value, our reputation and business would be harmed. any real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our platform, or any other failure of our platform to detect an advanced threat, could result in: a loss of existing or potential customers; delayed or lost revenue and adverse impacts to our business, operating results, and financial condition; a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance; the expenditure of significant financial and research and development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, and address and eliminate vulnerabilities; an increase in resources devoted to customer service and support, which could adversely affect our gross margin; harm to our reputation or brand; and claims and litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, enforcement actions, and other claims and liabilities, all of which may be costly and burdensome and further harm our reputation. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are launched against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. moreover, if a high-profile cybersecurity incident occurs with respect to another saas provider, customers may lose trust in the security of the saas business model generally, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. in the last few years there have been many successful advanced cybersecurity incidents that have damaged several prominent companies in spite of strong information security measures. we expect that the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents and the costs of preventing such attacks will continue to increase in the future. in addition, we cannot assure you that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers, or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matter or as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the u.s. or other countries. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our reputation. we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. existing and future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services, products, technologies, or talent. for example, in february 2021 we acquired scalyr, a data analytics company and in may 2022 we acquired attivo, a leading identity security and lateral movement protection company. we have also invested in certain privately held companies through our s ventures fund. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner is not guaranteed. in the future, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. our due diligence efforts may fail to identify all of the challenges, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings involved in an acquisition. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we announce or complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or investors. in addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating existing and future acquisitions, or the technologies and personnel associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. additionally, integrations could take longer than expected, or if we move too quickly in trying to integrate an acquisition, strategic investment, partnership, or other alliance, we may fail to achieve the desired efficiencies. we have, and may in the future have, to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders, which depending on the size of the acquisition, may be significant. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include: diversion of management’s time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; the inability to coordinate research and development and sales and marketing functions; the inability to integrate product and service offerings; retention of key employees from the acquired company; changes in relationships with strategic partners or the loss of any key customers or partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition; cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; integration of the acquired company’s accounting, crm, management information, human resources and other administrative systems; the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies; unexpected security risks or higher than expected costs to improve the security posture of the acquired company; higher than expected costs to bring the acquired company’s it infrastructure up to our standards; additional legal, regulatory or compliance requirements; financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we don’t adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect; liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment; and litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from or against terminated employees, customers, current and former stockholders or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. if we are unable to retain our customers, renew and expand our relationships with them, and add new customers, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. in recent periods, we have experienced rapid growth in the adoption of our platform, customer base and revenue. however, we may not continue to grow or grow at the same rate in the future. any success that we may experience in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things: maintain, renew and expand our existing customer base; continue to attract new customers; induce customers to expand deployment of the initially adopted module(s) of our platform across their organizations and infrastructure, and to adopt additional modules of our platform and services; improve the capabilities of our platform through research and development; continue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; and successfully compete with other companies in the endpoint security industry. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one to three years, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths or cease using certain features. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solution, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition, general economic conditions, or the perceived decline in the incidence of cyberattacks. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, operating results, and financial condition will materially suffer. if our platform is not effectively interoperated within our customers’ it infrastructure, deployments could be delayed or canceled, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. our platform must effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing it infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products and services from multiple vendors, and contains multiple generations of products and services that have been added over time. as a result, our solutions can sometimes encounter interoperability issues on deployment or over time, which require additional support and problem solving with customers, in some cases, at a substantial cost to us. we may modify our software or introduce new capabilities so that our platform interoperates with a customer’s infrastructure. these issues could cause longer deployment and integration times for our platform, leading to customer churn, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. in addition, government and other customers may require our platform to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. if we are unable to achieve, or are delayed in achieving, compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our platform to such customers, or may otherwise be at a competitive disadvantage, either of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our platform could adversely impact our customer relationships and overall business. our platform is hosted by third-party cloud hosting providers including amazon web services (aws). our software and systems are designed to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by such cloud hosting providers, and currently our cloud service infrastructure is primarily run on aws. we have experienced, and expect in the future that we may experience from time to time, interruptions, delays or outages in service availability due to a variety of factors. capacity constraints could arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks. the level of service provided by our cloud hosting providers, or regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also impact the use of, and our customers’ satisfaction with, our platform and could harm our business and reputation. in addition, hosting costs are expected to increase as our customer base grows, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, aws has discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us, including on contract renewal, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. aws, and other cloud hosting providers, may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, competing with us, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process data on their system in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. although we obtain services from other cloud hosting providers, if our current arrangement with aws were terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our content available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for expansion and transition to alternative cloud hosting and infrastructure services. such a transition could require further technical changes to our platform, including, but not limited to, our cloud service infrastructure which was initially designed to run on aws. making such changes could be costly in terms of time and financial resources. any of these factors could reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause our customers to decline to renew their subscriptions, any of which would harm our business and operating results. we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grows. as our customers gain more experience with our platform, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, and the number of locations where our platform is being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications, and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. in some circumstances, we may also determine to scale our technology through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development, which may divert management’s time and resources. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solution, we will not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we will be unable to compete as effectively and our business and operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate and promptly respond to changes in our customers’ technologies, business plans or security needs, our competitive position and prospects will be adversely impacted. the cybersecurity market has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. moreover, many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network-connected endpoints and adapt to increasingly complex it environments, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. as their technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. we face significant challenges in ensuring that our platform effectively identifies and responds to these advanced and evolving attacks. as a result of the continued rapid innovations in the technology industry, including the rapid growth of smartphones, tablets and other devices, enterprise employees using personal devices for work, and the rapidly evolving internet of things, we expect the networks of our customers to continue to change rapidly and become more complex. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, enhancements to our platform that adequately address the changing needs of our customers. in addition, any enhancements to our platform could involve research and development processes that are more complex, expensive and time-consuming than we anticipate. we may experience unanticipated delays in the availability of enhancements to our platform and may fail to meet customer expectations with respect to the timing of such availability. if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing and releasing updates to our platform on a timely basis that can adequately respond to advanced threats and our customers’ evolving needs, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and our reputation as a leading provider of endpoint security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to develop additional features for our platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions, our marketing efforts, and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. under certain circumstances, our employees may have access to our customers’ platforms. an employee may take advantage of such access to conduct malicious activities. any such misuse of our platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and operating results. in addition, independent industry and research firms often evaluate our solutions and provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or research firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. moreover, the performance of our channel partners and alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and alliance partners, or if our channel partners or alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be harmed. substantially all of our sales are fulfilled through our channel partners, including resellers, distributors, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms, and we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from channel partners for the foreseeable future. our channel partners generated 90%, 92%, and 96% of our revenue for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. our largest channel partner for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, was exclusive networks. we generated 18%, 18%, and 19% of our revenue from exclusive networks for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. our agreements with our channel partners, including agreements with exclusive networks, are non-exclusive, do not last for set terms, and may be terminated by either party at any time. further, channel partners fulfill our sales on a purchase order basis and do not impose minimum purchase requirements or related terms on sales. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. to the extent our partners are unsuccessful in selling our platform, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high-quality partners in each of the regions in which we sell or plan to sell our platform, we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our platform, or our partners shift focus to other vendors and/or our competitors, our ability to sell our platform and operating results will be harmed. the termination of our relationship with any significant partner may adversely affect our sales and operating results. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our ability to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform. we are also exposed to credit and liquidity risks and our operating results will be harmed if our partners were to become unable or unwilling to pay us at all or in a timely manner, terminate their relationships with us or go out of business. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate such risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our risks. if we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed. if partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these partners, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. our partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners. in such instances, we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity, and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited. we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners, as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible, which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could adversely affect our business and operating results. our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable and subject to budgetary uncertainty. we have made significant investments to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. although we anticipate that they may increase in the future, sales to governmental organizations have not accounted for, and may never account for, a significant portion of our revenue. sales to governmental organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely affect our business and operating results, including the following risks: selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale; government certification, software supply chain or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our platform may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the governmental sector until we have attained the revised certification or meet other new requirements. for example, although sentinelone is currently fedramp authorized, such authorization is costly to maintain and subject to rigorous compliance and if we lose our authorization, it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers; government demand and payment for our platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our platform, including as a result of sudden, unforeseen and disruptive events such as government shut downs, war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics; governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and operating results, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if an investigation, audit, or other review, were to uncover improper or illegal activities; governments may require certain products to be manufactured, produced, hosted or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost locations, and we may not produce or host all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies; and refusal to grant certain certifications or clearance by one government agency, or decision by one government agency that our products do not meet certain standards, may cause reputational harm and cause concern with other government agencies. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governmental organizations to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results. our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sale of our platform to customers located outside of the united states and our current, and any further, expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are generating a growing portion of our revenue outside of the united states, and conduct our business activities in various foreign countries, including some emerging markets where we have limited experience, where the challenges of conducting our business can be significantly different from those we have faced in more developed markets and where business practices may create internal control risks including: fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could add volatility to our operating results; new, or changes in, regulatory requirements; tariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures; exposure to numerous, increasing, stringent (particularly in the european union), and potentially inconsistent laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security; costs of localizing products and services; lack of acceptance of localized products and services; the need to make significant investments in people, solutions and infrastructure, typically well in advance of revenue generation; challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs; difficulties in maintaining our corporate culture with a dispersed and distant workforce; treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and other potential tax issues, including with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements; different or weaker protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property; economic weakness or currency-related crises; compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, data privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur; vetting and monitoring our third-party channel partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures; the lack of reference customers and other marketing assets in regional markets that are new or developing for us, as well as other adaptations in our market generation efforts that we may be slow to identify and implement; dependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics, including the covid-19 pandemic and the conflict in ukraine; instability in the global banking system; corporate espionage; and political instability and security risks in the countries where we are doing business and changes in the public perception of governments in the countries where we operate or plan to operate. we have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, additional corporate operating restructurings from time to time that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad. we consider various factors in evaluating these restructurings, including the alignment of our corporate legal entity structure with our organizational structure and its objectives, the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure, and the long-term cash flows and cash needs of our business. such restructurings increase our operating costs, and if ineffectual, could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate. we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage our future growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and we expect to continue to invest broadly across our organization to support our growth. for example, our headcount grew from over 1,200 employees as of january 31, 2022, to over 2,100 employees as of january 31, 2023. although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not sustain our current growth rates, nor can we assure you that our investments to support our growth will be successful. the growth and expansion of our business will require us to invest significant financial and operational resources and the continuous dedication of our management team. in addition, as we have grown, our number of customers has also increased significantly, and we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our platform in more complex computing environments. the rapid growth and expansion of our business places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. if we continue to experience rapid growth, we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. for example, as we grow, we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. as we grow, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. any future growth will continue to add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, cause difficulty or delays in deploying new customers, reduce demand for our platform, cause difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our platform, particularly with respect to large organizations and government entities. for example, in light of current macroeconomic conditions, we have observed a lengthening of the sales cycle for some prospective customers that we attribute to higher cost-consciousness around it budgets. customers often view the subscription to our platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular, often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens our sales cycle. our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. the sales prices of our platform may decrease, or the mix of our sales may change, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform. as the market for endpoint security matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that are similar to or compete with ours, we may be unable to effectively optimize our prices through increases or decreases, attract new customers at our offered prices or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. further, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services. this could lead customers to demand greater price concessions or additional functionality at the same price levels. as a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or provide more features without corresponding increases in price, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the term of their subscription, which is generally one to three years. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decrease in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide partial refunds or our customers could be entitled to terminate their contracts and our business would suffer. certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability of our platform and our support services. failure of or disruption to our infrastructure or third-party hosting service providers could impact the performance of our platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with credit, partial refunds or termination rights. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheets for such commitments. our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our platform will harm our business and operating results. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. the sale and support of our platform also entails the risk of product liability claims. we employ measures in the form of policy and technical controls to limit unauthorized access to our platform by our employees, customers and third-parties, however, these measures may not fully or effectively protect our platform from unauthorized access. additionally, we typically provide indemnification to customers, partners or other third parties we do business with for certain losses suffered or expenses incurred as a result of third-party claims arising from our infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. we also provide unlimited liability for certain breaches of confidentiality, as defined in our master subscription agreement. we also provide limited liability in the event of certain breaches of our master subscription agreement. certain of these contractual provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. to date, we have not incurred any material costs because of such obligations. however, as we continue to grow, indemnification claims against us for the obligations listed will increase. when our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our platform, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or in certain limited circumstances, other claims, would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. additionally, our platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our platform, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover the claims asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we have offered some of our customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have remediated warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering warranties which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, although the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control (ofac), list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise subject to u.s. sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions, in violation of our warranty and applicable law. risks related to our people we rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including members of our board of directors, could harm our business. our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to hire, integrate, train, manage, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. the loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team or members of our board of directors, as well as certain of our key marketing, sales, finance, support, product development, people team, or technology personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of tomer weingarten, our co-founder, chairman of the board of directors, president, and chief executive officer, who is critical to the development of our technology, platform, future vision, and strategic direction. from time to time, there have been and may in the future be changes in our management team. while we seek to manage any such transitions carefully, such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge, cause disruptions to our business and negatively affect our business. competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, especially in the san francisco bay area and in israel, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. more generally, the technology industry, and the cybersecurity industry more specifically, is also subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and related services. moreover, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. we have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. we may be required to provide more training to our personnel than we currently anticipate. further, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, overall macroeconomics and workforce participation rates. restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may also negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. changes in u.s. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. our business may be adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes. moreover, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team, sales team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards and other compensation they receive in connection with their employment. if the perceived value of our compensatory package declines, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. further, our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. in recent years, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key employees, these agreements are on an “at-will” basis, meaning they are able to terminate their employment with us at any time. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be severely harmed. if we do not effectively hire, integrate, train, manage, and retain additional sales personnel, and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may be unable to increase our customer base and increase sales to our existing customers. our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to expand our sales and marketing operations. we have and plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs and to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to target additional potential customers, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting and maintaining additional customers. if we are unable to find efficient ways to deploy our sales and marketing investments or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, our business and operating results would be adversely affected. furthermore, we plan to continue expanding our sales force and there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our success in hiring, integrating, training, managing, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth, particularly in international markets. new hires require significant training and may take extended time before they are productive. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, or at all, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. moreover, our international expansion may be slow or unsuccessful if we are unable to retain qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets in which we target. if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, manage, and retain a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. any inability to maintain a high-quality customer support organization could lead to a lack of customer satisfaction, which could hurt our customer relationships and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. once our platform is deployed within our customers’ computing environments, our customers rely on our technical support services to assist with service customization and optimization and to resolve certain issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our platform and advanced services. if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our platform, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services as part of our platform to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our product and business reputation and on positive recommendations, referrals, and peer promotions from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial condition. we believe that our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed. we believe that our corporate culture has been, and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. if we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, inclusion, creativity, and teamwork that we believe is important to support our growth. as we implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively impact our future success. we are also taking steps to develop a more inclusive and diverse workforce, however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to our intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our platform without compensating us. we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, and confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our technology. valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or platform. any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. in addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications. such changes may lead to uncertainties or increased costs and risks surrounding the prosecution, validity, ownership, enforcement, and defense of our issued patents and patent applications and other intellectual property, the outcome of third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property brought against us and the actual or enhanced damages (including treble damages) that may be awarded in connection with any such current or future claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. however, such agreements may not be enforceable in full or in part in all jurisdictions and any breach could negatively affect our business and our remedy for such breach may be limited. the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. lastly, the measures we employ to limit the access and distribution of our proprietary information may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property. as such, we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. policing unauthorized use of our technology or platform is difficult. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states. for example, many foreign countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. effective trade secret protection may also not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have employees or independent contractors. the loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality. in addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and employment laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. from time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other ip rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and platform protected other than by patent rights), we will find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create our platform and other innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. third parties have claimed and may claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights and this may create liability for us or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our current or future products and services infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may result in legal claims against our channel partners, our alliance partners, our customers and us. these claims may damage our brand and reputation, harm our customer relationships, and create liability for us. we expect the number of such claims to increase as the number of products and services and the level of competition in our market grows, as the functionality of our platform overlaps with that of other products and services, and as the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase. we generally agree in our customer and partner contracts to indemnify customers for certain expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third-party intellectual property infringement claims associated with our platform. to the extent that any claim arises as a result of third-party technology we have licensed for use in our platform, we may be unable to recover from the appropriate third party any expenses or other liabilities that we incur. companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. furthermore, patent holding companies, non-practicing entities, and other adverse patent owners that are not deterred by our existing intellectual property protections may seek to assert patent claims against us. from time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have invited us to license their patents and may, in the future, assert patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, our alliance partners, or our customers. we have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. in may 2021, and thereafter, we have received communications from international business machines corporation (ibm), alleging that we infringe on u.s. patents held by ibm. we have also asserted that ibm infringes certain patents held by us. to date, no litigation has been filed in this matter. based on our review of the patents at issue, we believe we have meritorious defenses to ibm’s allegations, although there can be no assurance that litigation will not commence, or that we will be successful in such litigation or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. in november 2022 we received communications from at&t alleging that our platform integrated into an at&t offering is subject to a third-party patent infringement claim and that we may be required to indemnify at&t. to date, no litigation has been filed in this matter. based on our review and analysis of the matter and allegations at issue, we are vigorously contesting the indemnity claim, although, there can be no assurances that litigation will not commence, that we will be successful in such litigation, or that we will reach a satisfactory business resolution. there may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods and assets. we may also face exposure to third-party intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation actions if we engage software engineers or other personnel who were previously engaged by competitors or other third parties and those personnel inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of third parties into our products. in addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market, and support potential products or enhancements, which could severely harm our business. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate, and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. these claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, and may require us to indemnify our customers for liabilities they incur as a result of such claims. these claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. we might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. alternatively, we could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort, and expense, and may affect the performance or features of our platform. if we cannot license or develop alternative non-infringing substitutes for any infringing technology used in any aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our platform and may be unable to compete effectively. any of these results would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business. we currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. licensing technologies from third parties exposes us to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement and vulnerabilities due to, among other things, our lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the care taken to safeguard against risks. we cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our platform. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business, including our financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner, or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. third-party software we rely on may be updated infrequently, unsupported or subject to vulnerabilities that may not be patched in a timely manner, any of which may expose our solutions to vulnerabilities. as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation. our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code, which they are not typically required to maintain and update, and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. although we monitor our use of open source software in an effort both to comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses and to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon our use and distribution of the open source software. if we combine and distribute our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release combined the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solution, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our platform, and reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims, regardless of validity, could result in time consuming and costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention away from developing the business, expose us to customer indemnity claims, or force us to disclose source code. litigation could be costly for us to defend, result in paying damages, entering into unfavorable licenses, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or cause delays by requiring us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solution."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to legal and regulatory matters we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in our markets. our platform and related technology is subject to u.s. export controls, including the u.s. department of commerce’s export administration regulations (ear), and we and our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties are also subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by ofac and other u.s. government agencies. we incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our platform, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the u.s. only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. we also offer certain customers a ransomware warranty in addition to their subscriptions, providing coverage in the form of a limited monetary payment if they are affected by a ransomware attack (as specified in our ransomware warranty agreement), and though the terms of the warranty do not allow those customers to use warranty claim payments to fund payments to persons on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or who are otherwise prohibited to receive such payments under u.s. sanctions, we cannot assure you that all of our customers will comply with our warranty terms or refrain from taking actions in violation of our warranty and applicable law. furthermore, u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export and re-export of certain hardware and software and the provision of certain cloud-based solutions to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by u.s. sanctions and for certain end-uses. as an example, following russia’s invasion of ukraine, the united states and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against russia and belarus. the united states and its allies could expand and strengthen these sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. these restrictions would further impact our ability to do business in certain parts of the world and to do business with certain persons and entities, including selling our services and using local developers. we also collect information about cyber threats from open sources, intermediaries and third parties that we make available to our customers in our threat industry publications. while we have implemented certain procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the collection and distribution of this information, we cannot assure you that these procedures have been effective or that we, or third parties who we do not control, have complied with all laws or regulations in this regard. failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the collection and distribution of this information also could have negative consequences to us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties. although we take precautions to prevent our information collection practices and services from being provided in violation of such laws, our information collection practices and services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws. if we or our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets or otherwise. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries. additionally, export restrictions recently imposed on russia and belarus specifically limit the export of encryption hardware, software and related source code and technology to these locations which could limit our ability to provide our software and services to these countries. changes in our platform or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 (fcpa), as amended, the united kingdom bribery act 2010 (the bribery act), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the public, and in certain cases, private sector. we leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents and channel partners, to conduct our business in the united states and abroad, to sell subscriptions to our platform and to collect information about cyber threats. we and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries and other third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with fcpa, bribery act and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries or other third parties have not taken, or will not take actions, in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we increase our international sales and business, including our business with government organizations, our risks under these laws may increase. noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and"
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"other consequences. any investigations, actions or sanctions could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. if we fail to adequately protect personal information or other information we collect, process, share or maintain under applicable laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. we receive, store, and process some personal information from our employees, customers, the employees of our customers, and our end users. this personal information is hosted by our third-party service providers. a wide variety of state, national, and international laws, as well as regulations and industry standards apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information and other information, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent across countries or conflict with other rules. data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in ever increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. failure to comply with laws, regulations and industry standards regarding personal information or other information could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems, and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. in the united states, there are numerous federal and state consumer, privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information, including security breach notification laws and consumer protection laws. each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and constantly evolving. notably, but not necessarily limited to, we may be subject to: controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (can-spam) and similar state consumer protection laws regarding the use of telephones and text messaging for marketing purposes. section 5(a) of the federal trade commission (ftc) act for violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, resulting in a finding of an unfair act or practice. the ccpa, effective since january 1, 2020, which created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to california residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. a ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act, or cpra, took effect january 1, 2023 (with a look back to january 2022), with enforcement beginning on july 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the ccpa, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal data. the cpra also creates a new state agency, known as the california privacy protection agency, that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra. potential uncertainty surrounding the ccpa and cpra may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, particularly in the event of a data breach, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. other states have followed california: virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act that also became effective january 1, 2023; colorado enacted its colorado privacy act, which will become effective july 1, 2023; connecticut passed the connecticut data privacy act (cdpa), which will become effective july 1, 2023; and utah enacted the utah consumer privacy act (ucpa), which will become effective december 31, 2023; and as the year 2023 began, four states had pending consumer privacy legislation under review, which if enacted, would add additional costs and expense of resources to maintain compliance. in certain circumstances, we may be subject to the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) (established in 2018 and implemented by countries in the eea) and the u.k. general data protection regulation and u.k. data protection act 2018 (u.k. gdpr), which respectively govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of natural persons, and it applies extra-territorially and imposes onerous requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours). companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 percent of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. additionally, following the withdrawal by the united kingdom (u.k.) from the european union and the eea, companies must comply with both the gdpr and the u.k. gdpr as incorporated into united kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4 percent of global turnover. in addition to the foregoing, a breach of the gdpr or u.k. gdpr could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). we may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. the gdpr and u.k. gdpr requires, among other things, that personal information only be transferred outside of the eea, or the u.k., respectively to jurisdictions that have been deemed adequate (also known as “third countries,” which at present time includes the united states) by the european commission or by the u.k. data protection regulator, respectively. accordingly, personal information may not be transferred to those jurisdictions that have not been deemed adequate, unless steps are taken to legitimize those data transfers. switzerland follows similar legal practices. previously, we relied on the e.u.-u.s. privacy shield framework to provide a mechanism for the transfer of data from e.u. member states to the united states, but this was invalidated by the european court of justice (cjeu) on july 16, 2020, on the grounds that the privacy shield failed to offer adequate protections to e.u. personal information transferred to the united states. we previously relied on our own, as well as our vendors’, privacy shield certification for the purposes of transferring personal data from the eea to the united states in compliance with the gdpr/u.k. gdpr’s data export conditions, which are no longer allowed. one such alternative to the privacy shield is the use of standard contractual clauses (sccs), a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, may not be alone sufficient to protect data transferred to the united states or other third countries under certain circumstances without making a case-by-case basis assessment of the legal regime applicable in the destination country according to the cjeu. on june 28, 2021, the european commission issued an adequacy decision for personal information transfers from the eea to the u.k., with a sunset clause of four years, meaning that the european commission will review and renew only if the european commission considers that the u.k. continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection. notably, the european commission reserved a right to intervene at any time during the four-year adequacy period if the u.k. deviates from the level of protection then in place. if this adequacy decision is reversed by the european commission, we would have to implement protection measures such as the sccs for data transfers between the e.u. and the u.k. or find alternative solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data from the e.u. into the u.k. some countries (including some outside the eea) also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services if we were to operate in those countries. if we are required to implement additional measures to transfer data from the eea, this could increase our compliance costs, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the myriad international and u.s. privacy and data breach laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. in many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising. in addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. as supervisory authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal information transfers (including regarding data export and circumstances in which we cannot use the sccs), we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines. if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, adversely affecting our financial results, and possibly making it necessary to establish systems in the eea, switzerland, and the u.k. to maintain personal data originating from those jurisdictions that adds expenses and may create distractions from our other business pursuits. loss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims. we are also subject to evolving e.u. and u.k. privacy laws on cookies and electronic marketing. in the e.u. and the u.k., informed opt-in consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. the gdpr also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. while we anticipate the development of the eprivacy regulation to govern cookies and e-marketing, recent european court decisions and regulators’ guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. if regulators start to enforce the strict approach in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. regulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand users. similar concerns may happen under the new cpra regime in california. additionally, by expanding into the e.u. and u.k., we may also trigger article 3(2) of the gdpr/u.k. gdpr directly as we may be considered to be monitoring data subjects. to the extent we process personal data on behalf of our customers for the provision of services, we have, and may in the future, also be required to enter into data processing agreements which comply with article 28 of the gdpr/u.k. gdpr. we depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process personal data on our behalf or as our sub-processor. to the extent required by applicable law, we attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using third parties by performing security assessments and detailed due diligence, entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that providers only process personal data according to our instructions or comparable instructions to the instructions of our customer (as applicable), and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. there is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. any violation of data or security laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties under the gdpr and the u.k. gdpr outlined above. in recent years, some regulators have proposed or introduced cybersecurity licensing requirements or certification regimes for specific sectors, such as critical infrastructure. these may impose new requirements on us or our current or prospective customer including, but not limited to, data processing locations, breach notification, and security standards. such requirements may cause us to incur significant organizational costs and increase barriers of entry into new markets. new worldwide data protection laws, including the u.s. and european jurisdictions described above, may lead to ever changing definitions of personal information and other sensitive information which may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. notably some foreign jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these respective jurisdictions. our failure to comply with applicable laws, directives, and regulations may result in enforcement action against us, including fines, and damage to our reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. any failure or perceived failure by us, even if unfounded, to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to customers, users or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. for example, in 2017, we reached a consent agreement with the ftc, to resolve an investigation relating to certain disclosures in our privacy policy. the consent agreement requires us, among other things, to provide information about our compliance with the ftc order and about representations made in our marketing materials. we may be subject to future investigations and legal proceedings by the ftc or other regulators. a such, it is possible that a regulatory inquiry might result in changes to our policies or business practices. violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, it is possible that future orders issued by, or enforcement actions initiated by, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of our customers’ data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained – or in how these applicable laws, regulations or industry practices are interpreted and enforced by state, federal and international privacy regulators – could require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and fines, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features that make use of the data that our customers voluntarily share with us. any security breach or incident, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus, malware, ransomware, denial of service, credential stuffing attack, supply chain attack, hacking or similar breach involving our networks and systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, could result in the loss of customer data, including personal information, disruption to our operations, significant remediation costs, lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. these attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations, and security breaches and incidents may arise from other sources, such as employee or contractor error or malfeasance. cyber threats are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. as a cybersecurity company, we have been and may continue to be specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. our industry is experiencing an increase in phishing attacks and unauthorized scans of systems searching for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to exploit. if our security measures are breached or otherwise compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, defect, vulnerability or bug in our products or products of third parties upon which we rely, malfeasance or otherwise, including any such breach or compromise resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our confidential information, including personal information or the personal information of our customers or others, or if any of these are perceived or reported to occur, we may suffer the loss, compromise, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of our or others’ confidential information and personal information, we may face a loss in intellectual property protection, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could be subject to claims, demands, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, indemnity obligations, and otherwise incur significant liability. even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers. further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any security incident or breach, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to any security breach or incident. techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems or networks are constantly evolving and, in some instances, are not identified until launched against a target. we and our third-party vendors and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with russia’s invasion of ukraine, we and our third-party vendors and service providers are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches from nation-state and affiliated actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our products and services as well as retaliatory cybersecurity attacks from russian and russian-affiliated actors against companies with a u.s. presence. in addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the united states and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. we may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and customers regarding our products and services and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own supply chain. we and our customers may also experience increased costs associated with security measures and increased risk of suffering cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks. should we or the third-party vendors and service providers upon which we rely experience such attacks, including from ransomware or other security breaches or incidents, our operations may also be hindered or interrupted due to system disruptions or otherwise, with foreseeable secondary contractual, regulatory, financial and reputational harms that may arise from such an incident. further, we cannot assure that any limitations of liability provisions in our customer agreements, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security incident. we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. we may become involved in litigation that may adversely affect us. from time to time, we have been subject to claims, suits and other proceedings. for example, we are currently the subject of litigation with blackberry corp. for additional information regarding this litigation, see the section titled “part i—legal proceedings.” regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to financial and accounting matters the requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, result in significant costs and may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. as a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the new york stock exchange (nyse). we expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our financial statements and in the reports that we will file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired companies may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results, may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our annual reports on form 10-k filed with the sec beginning in fiscal year 2023. ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our class a common stock. our management is also required, pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other esg-focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. we have incurred significant costs with respect to our directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage. in the future, it may be more expensive or more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. these factors would also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. being a public company requires significant resources and management oversight. as a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"we could be subject to additional tax liabilities and united states federal and global income tax reform could adversely affect us. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the united states and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and transaction taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. in addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws in the united states or in other jurisdictions in which we operate. for example, the united states tax law legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax act) (as modified by the coronavirus aid, relief, economic security act, the families first coronavirus response act and the american rescue plan act), significantly reformed the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (or the internal revenue code), reducing u.s. federal tax rates, making sweeping changes to rules governing international business operations, and imposing significant additional limitations on tax benefits, including the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating loss carryforwards. on august 16, 2022, president biden signed the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) into law. the ira contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on certain corporate stock buy-backs taking place after december 31, 2022. we are currently evaluating the various provisions of the ira and currently anticipate that its impact, if any, will not be material to our operating results or cash flows. in the united states, congress and the biden administration continue to consider other proposed legislation to make various tax law changes. these proposals, could include changes to the existing framework in respect of income taxes, limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits, as well as add new types of non-income taxes (such as taxes based on a percentage of revenue or taxes applicable to digital services). in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) inclusive framework of 137 jurisdictions have joined a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation rules. the first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between countries for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with global turnover above 20 billion euros. the second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent applicable to in-scope multinational enterprises and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with annual consolidated group revenue in excess of 750 million euro. while substantial work remains to be completed by the oecd and national governments on the implementation of these proposals, future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. as of january 31, 2023, we had aggregate u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $651.1 million and $338.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for u.s. income tax purposes. if not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024. in addition, as of january 31, 2023, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $2.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2037, and state research and development credit carryforwards of $2.0 million, which do not expire. we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $289.8 million, as of january 31, 2023, which do not expire. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that certain of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. similar rules apply under u.s. state tax laws. we have, and may in the future, experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change u.s. net operating loss carryforwards to offset u.s. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. we could be required to collect additional sales, use, value added, digital services, or other similar taxes or be subject to other liabilities with respect to past or future sales, that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our solutions and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we do not collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, value added, digital services, or assert other tax collection obligations on us that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. further, an increasing number of u.s. states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. a successful assertion by one or more u.s. states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as interest and penalties. furthermore, certain jurisdictions, such as the u.k. and france, have recently introduced a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting similar laws. a successful assertion by a u.s. state or local government, or other country or jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, value added, digital services or other similar taxes could, among other things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage potential customers from subscribing to our platform due to the incremental cost of any such sales or other related taxes, or otherwise harm our business. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our operating results and financial condition. we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business and growth in international markets. we generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets, and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions will depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our intercompany transactions, international business activities, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. furthermore, increases in tax rates, new or revised tax laws, and new interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, could result in an increase in our overall tax obligations which could adversely affect our business. our intercompany relationships and intercompany transactions are subject to complex transfer pricing rules administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate with potentially divergent tax laws. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions will depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our intercompany transactions, international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies by taxing authorities and courts in various jurisdictions, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. it is not uncommon for tax authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, the transfer pricing and charges for intercompany services and other intercompany transactions, or with respect to the valuation of our intellectual property and the manner in which our intellectual property is utilized within our group. in 2022, we began negotiating a bilateral advance pricing agreement (apa) with the united states and the israeli governments, covering various transfer pricing matters for intercompany transactions relating to the intergroup utilization of our intellectual property among our group enterprises. an apa, if obtained, will provide us with a more predictable future business operating model, and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making certain transfer pricing adjustments within the scope of these agreements. these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. if taxing authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international operations were to successfully challenge our transfer pricing, we could be required to reallocate part or all of our income to reflect transfer pricing adjustments, which could result in an increased tax liability to us. in such circumstances, if the country from where the income was reallocated did not agree to the reallocation, we could become subject to tax on the same income in both countries, resulting in double taxation. furthermore, the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. we believe that our tax and financial accounting positions are reasonable and our tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liability. we also believe that our assumptions, judgements, and estimates are reasonable and that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions are on arm’s-length terms. however, the relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions, including any assumptions, judgements or estimates used for these transfer pricing matters and intercompany transactions. if any of these tax authorities determine that our transfer pricing for these intercompany transactions do not meet arm’s-length criteria, and were successful in challenging our positions, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties related thereto, which could be in excess of any reserves established therefor, and which could result in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, including in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and such jurisdictions may assess new or additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our operating results could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to those related to stock-based compensation, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, standalone selling prices for each performance obligation, useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate used for operating lease liabilities, and accounting for income taxes. our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a potential decline in the market price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. for example, sec proposals on climate-related disclosures may require us to update our accounting or operational policies, processes, or systems to reflect new or amended financial reporting standards. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may adversely affect our financial results. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our sales contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, strengthening of the u.s. dollar increases the real cost of our platform to our customers outside of the united states, which could lead to delays in the purchase of our platform and the lengthening of our sales cycle. if the u.s. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, increased international sales in the future, including through continued international expansion, our channel partners and other partnerships, could result in foreign currency denominated sales, which would increase our foreign currency risk. our operating expenses incurred outside the u.s. and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations but may do so, or use other derivative instruments, in the future. we may require additional capital to fund our business and support our growth, and any inability to generate or obtain such capital may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in order to support our growth and respond to business challenges, such as developing new features or enhancements to our platform to stay competitive, acquiring new technologies, and improving our infrastructure, we have made significant financial investments in our business and we intend to continue to make such investments. as a result, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to provide the funds required for these investments and other business endeavors. if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to those of holders of our class a common stock. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. if we obtain additional funds through debt financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us. such terms may involve restrictive covenants making it difficult to engage in capital raising activities and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. the trading prices of technology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the conflict in ukraine, inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the banking system, and market downturns, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. in addition, a recession, depression, or other sustained adverse market event could adversely affect our business and the value of our class a common stock. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be adversely affected, requiring us to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our operations."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. our class a common stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; the overall performance of the stock market or technology companies; the number of shares of our class a common stock publicly owned and available for trading; failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; litigation or other proceedings involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; any major changes in our management or our board of directors; interest rate changes or fluctuations; and other events or factors, including those resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, war, such as russia’s invasion of ukraine, armed conflict, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies, particularly during the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty, including rising inflation, increasing interest rates, labor shortages and fluctuations in international currency rates, as well as the impacts of the current conflict in ukraine and the covid-19 pandemic. these economic, political, regulatory and market conditions have and may continue to negatively impact the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock into the public market, including shares of class a common stock held by our existing stockholders that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. in addition, pursuant to our amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, dated october 28, 2020, certain stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file a registration statement for the public resale of such capital stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline or be volatile. we may also issue our shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, an investment, or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the holders of our class b common stock who held, in the aggregate, approximately 85% of the voting power of our capital stock as of january 31, 2023, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. our class b common stock has 20 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. as of january 31, 2023, the holders of our outstanding class b common stock held approximately 85% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock, the holders of our class b common stock collectively are expected to continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of class b common stock, (ii) seven years from the date of our final prospectus, or june 29, 2028, (iii) the first date following the completion of our ipo on which the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) held by tomer weingarten, including certain permitted entities that mr. weingarten controls, is less than 25% of the number of shares of outstanding class b common stock (including shares of class b common stock subject to outstanding stock options) that mr. weingarten originally held as of the date of our final prospectus, (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors, following the first date following the completion of our ipo when mr. weingarten is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, consultant or member of our board of directors, (v) the date fixed by our board of directors following the date on which, if applicable, mr. weingarten is terminated for cause, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, and (vi) the date that is 12 months after the death or disability, as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation, of mr. weingarten. this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. in addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. future transfers by holders of our class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of our class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. the dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our class a common stock. we cannot predict whether our dual class structure will, over time, result in a lower or more volatile market price of our class a common stock, adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. certain stock index providers, such as s&p dow jones, exclude companies with multi-class share structures from being added to certain of its indices, including the s&p 500. in addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. as a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and may discourage such indices from selecting us for inclusion, notwithstanding our automatic termination provision, may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our class a common stock. any exclusion from certain stock indices could result in less demand for our class a common stock. any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our class a common stock."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"general risk factors adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. in addition, the purchase of our platform is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. weak global and regional economic conditions, including u.s. and global macro-economic issues, including global banking and finance related issues, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, spending environments, geopolitical instability, warfare and uncertainty, weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macro-economic conditions, including the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the war in ukraine, and proposed judicial reform in israel, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including resulting in longer sales cycles, a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers or expand our platform or sell additional products and services to our existing customers, lower prices for our platform, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced sales to new or existing customers and slower or declining growth. for example, as a result of current uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, we have recently observed a lengthening of the sales cycle for some prospective customers that we attribute to higher cost-consciousness around it budgets. we expect the macroeconomic conditions impacting demand to persist in the near-term. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. moreover, the u.s. capital markets have experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption. inflation rates in the u.s. significantly increased in 2022 resulting in federal action to increase interest rates, adversely affecting capital markets activity. further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and regulatory action may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, there has been recent turmoil in the global banking system. for example, on march 10, 2023, silicon valley bank (svb), one of our banking partners, was closed by the california department of financial protection and innovation, which appointed the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), as receiver. while we only had a minimal amount of our cash directly at svb and, since that date, the fdic has stated that all depositors of svb will be made whole, there is no guarantee that the federal government would guarantee all depositors as they did with svb depositors in the event of further bank closures and continued instability in the global banking system may negatively impact us or our customers, including our customers’ ability to pay for our platform, and adversely impact our business and financial condition. moreover, events such as the closure of svb, in addition to global macroeconomic conditions discussed above, may cause further turbulence and uncertainty in the capital markets. we may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as war, that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could have an adverse effect on us. our business operations are also subject to interruption by fire, power shortages, flooding, and other events beyond our control. in addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. for example, the ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the measures that we, our customers and governmental authorities have adopted, as described in detail elsewhere in these risk factors, have and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. in addition, our growth rate may actually slow or decline as the impact of the covid-19 pandemic tapers as people continue to return to offices and other workplaces. further, acts of war, armed conflict, terrorism and other geopolitical unrest, such as russia’s invasion of ukraine, could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. in the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, cyberattack, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in development of our platform, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of such natural disasters. for example, our corporate offices are located in california, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes, wildfires, heatwaves and droughts. additionally, all the aforementioned risks will be further increased if we do not implement an effective disaster recovery plan or our partners’ disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate."
S,2023-03-29,risk factors,"the covid-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact worldwide economic activity and financial markets. we have experienced, and may continue to experience negative impacts on certain parts of our business. the full extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. measures we have taken to mitigate the spread of the virus could negatively affect our customer success efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycle for some prospective customers and delay the delivery of professional services and trainings to our customers, impact our marketing, sales and support efforts, reduce employee efficiency and productivity, increase employee attrition, and create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. we do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business, operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the covid-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time. potential impacts include but are not limited to: our customer prospects and our existing customers may experience slowdowns in their businesses, which in turn may result in reduced demand for our platform, lengthening of sales cycles, loss of customers, and difficulties in collections; we have opened our offices in accordance with local ordinances, however, most of our employees continue to work from home and a substantial number may continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which may present challenges to employee collaboration, productivity and retention; we continue to incur fixed costs, particularly for real estate, and are deriving reduced or no benefit from those costs; we may continue to experience disruptions to our growth planning, such as for facilities and international expansion; we anticipate incurring costs in returning to work from our facilities around the world, including changes to the workplace, such as space planning, food service, and amenities; we may be subject to legal liability for safe workplace claims; and our critical vendors could go out of business; any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. investors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. there is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance matters (esg). some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. we may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the esg standards set by various constituencies. furthermore, if our competitors’ corporate social responsibility performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. in addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our class a common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our class a common stock or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. we could be subject to securities class action litigation. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. this type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may make it more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in the future and may require us to opt for lower overall policy limits and coverage or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs, or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. these factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or other change of control of the company that the stockholders may consider favorable. in addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that: provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; provide that only our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; do not provide for cumulative voting; provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders; provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our class b common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. moreover, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (dgcl), may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation contains exclusive forum provisions for certain claims, which may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. moreover, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder. our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the united states will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, or federal forum provision. our decision to adopt a federal forum provision followed a decision by the supreme court of the state of delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under delaware law. while there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the delaware supreme court or determine that the federal forum provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the federal forum provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder. in addition, the federal forum provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act. accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the federal forum provision. these provisions may limit a stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results."

results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading “special note about forward-looking statements” in this annual report on form 10-k. you should review the disclosure under the heading “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. our fiscal year ends on january 31, and our fiscal quarters end on april 30, july 31, october 31, and january 31. our fiscal years ended january 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are referred to herein as fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “sentinelone,” the “company,” “we” “our” “us,” or similar terms refer to sentinelone, inc. and its subsidiaries. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2022 filed with the sec on april 7, 2022. overview we founded sentinelone in 2013 with a dramatically new approach to cybersecurity. we pioneered the world’s first purpose-built ai-powered singularity platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous, from the endpoint and beyond. our singularity platform instantly defends against cyberattacks - performing at a faster speed, greater scale, and higher accuracy than otherwise possible from a human-powered approach. our singularity platform ingests, correlates, and queries petabytes of structured and unstructured data from a myriad of ever-expanding disparate external and internal sources in real-time. we build rich context and deliver greater visibility by constructing a dynamic representation of data across an organization. as a result, our ai models are highly accurate, actionable, and autonomous. our distributed ai models run both locally on every endpoint and every cloud workload, as well as on our cloud platform. our static and vector-agnostic behavioral ai models, which run on the endpoints themselves, provide our customers with protection even when their devices are not connected to the cloud. in the cloud, our streaming ai detects anomalies that surface when multiple data feeds are correlated. by providing full visibility into the storyline of every secured device across the organization through one console, our platform makes it very fast for analysts to easily search through petabytes of data to investigate incidents and proactively hunt threats. we have extended our control and visibility planes beyond the traditional endpoint to unmanaged iot devices. our singularity platform can be flexibly deployed on the environments that our customers choose, including public, private, or hybrid clouds. our feature parity across windows, macos, linux, and kubernetes offers best-of-breed protection, visibility, and control across today’s heterogeneous it environments. together, these capabilities make our platform the logical choice for organizations of all sizes, industry verticals, and compliance requirements. our platform offers true multi-tenancy, which enables some of the world’s largest organizations and our managed security providers and incident response partners with an excellent management experience. our customers realize improved cybersecurity outcomes with fewer people. we generate substantially all of our revenue by selling subscriptions to our singularity platform. our subscription tiers include singularity core, singularity control, and singularity complete. additionally, customers can extend the functionality of our platform through our subscription singularity modules. we generally price our subscriptions and modules on a per agent basis, and each agent generally corresponds with an endpoint, server, virtual machine, or container. our subscription contracts typically range from one to three years. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of a contract. most of our contracts are for terms representing annual increments, therefore contracts generally come up for renewal in the same period in subsequent years. the timing of large multi-year enterprise contracts can create some variability in subscription order levels between periods, though the impact to our revenue in any particular period is limited as a result of ratable revenue recognition. our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving expanded usage of our platform by existing customers. our sales organization is comprised of our enterprise sales, inside sales and customer solutions engineering teams. it leverages our global network of isvs, alliance partners, and channel partners for prospect access. additionally, our sales teams work closely with our customers, channel partners, and alliance partners to drive adoption of our platform, and our software solutions are fulfilled through our channel partners. our channel partners include some of the world’s largest resellers and distributors, msps, mssps, mdrs, oems, and ir firms. once customers experience the benefits of our platform, they often upgrade their subscriptions to benefit from the full range of our xdr and it and security operations capabilities. additionally, many of our customers adopt singularity modules over time to extend the functionality of our platform and increase their coverage footprint. the combination of platform upgrades and extended modules drives our powerful land-and-expand motion. our singularity platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. as of january 31, 2023, we had over 10,000 customers, increasing from over 6,700 customers as of january 31, 2022. we had 905 customers with arr of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2023, up from 520 customer with arr of $100,000 or more as of january 31, 2022. as of january 31, 2023 and 2022, no single end customer accounted for more than 4% of our arr. we define arr as the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and capacity contracts at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. our revenue outside of the united states represented 35% and 32% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, illustrating the global nature of our solutions. we have grown rapidly since our inception. our revenue was $422.2 million, $204.8 million, and $93.1 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 106% and 120%, respectively. during this period, we continued to invest in growing our business to capitalize on our market opportunity. as a result, our net loss for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $378.7 million, $271.1 million, and $117.6 million, respectively. key business metrics we monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions."
S,2023-03-29,managements discussion,"annualized recurring revenue (arr) we believe that arr is a key operating metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription and capacity customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing customers. arr represents the annualized revenue run rate of our subscription and capacity contracts at the end of a reporting period, assuming contracts are renewed on their existing terms for customers that are under contracts with us. arr is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates."
S,2023-03-29,managements discussion,"as of january 31, 2023 2022 2021 (in thousands) annualized recurring revenue $548,652 $292,341 $130,825"
S,2023-03-29,managements discussion,"arr grew 88% year-over-year to $548.7 million for fiscal 2023, primarily due to high growth in the number of new customers purchasing our subscriptions and to additional purchases by existing customers. arr is an operational metric, and there is no comparable gaap financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric. customers with arr of $100,000 or more we believe that our ability to increase the number of customers with arr of $100,000 or more is an indicator of our market penetration and strategic demand for our platform. we define a customer as an entity that has an active subscription for access to our platform. we count msps, mssps, mdrs, and oems, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. we do not count our reseller or distributor channel partners as customers."

S,2023-03-29,managements discussion,"revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our singularity platform. customers can extend the functionality of their subscription to our platform by subscribing to additional singularity modules. subscriptions provide access to hosted software. the nature of our promise to the customer under the subscription is to provide protection for the duration of the contractual term and as such is considered as a series of distinct services. our arrangements may include fixed consideration, variable consideration, or a combination of the two. fixed consideration is recognized over the term of the arrangement or longer if the fixed consideration relates to a material right. variable consideration in these arrangements is typically a function of transaction volume or another usage-based measure. depending upon the structure of a particular arrangement, we (1) allocate the variable amount to each distinct service period within the series and recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e. direct allocation), (2) estimate total variable consideration at contract inception (giving consideration to any constraints that may apply and updating the estimates as new information becomes available) and recognizes the total transaction price over the period to which it relates, or (3) apply the ‘right to invoice’ practical expedient and recognize revenue based on the amount invoiced to the customer during the period. premium support and maintenance and other singularity modules are distinct from subscriptions and are recognized ratably over the term as the performance obligations are satisfied. we invoice our customers upfront upon signing for the entire term of the contract, periodically, or in arrears. most of our subscription contracts have a term of one to three years. cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with the hosting and maintenance of our platform. cost of revenue also consists of personnel-related costs associated with our customer support and services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use software, software and subscription services used by our customer support and services team, and allocated overhead costs. our third-party cloud infrastructure costs are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of endpoints per customer, the number of modules, and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules. we plan to continue to invest in our platform infrastructure and additional resources in our customer support and services organization as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue from period to period. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. operating expenses also include allocated facilities and it overhead costs. research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. research and development expenses also include consulting fees, software and subscription services, and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform and modules. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase investments in our existing products and services. however, we anticipate research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period depending on the timing of these expenses. in addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment related expenses, advertising, branding and marketing events, promotions, and software and subscription services. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third parties that are incremental to obtain a subscription contract. such costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of four years, and any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription are capitalized and amortized over the average contractual term of the renewal. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base, but to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time. general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other expenses for our executive, finance, legal, people team, and facilities organizations. general and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, other consulting, and professional services fees, software and subscription services, and other corporate expenses. we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time. interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and investments. interest expense consists primarily of the amortization of the discount related to attivo indemnity escrow liability. other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses."

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"if organizations do not adopt cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions. the use of saas solutions to manage and automate security and it operations is at an early stage and rapidly evolving. as such, it is difficult to predict its potential growth, if any, customer adoption and retention rates, customer demand for our solutions, customer consolidation on our platform, or the success of existing competitive products. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our solutions and those of our competitors. if our solutions do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our solutions due to a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products, privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results. we do not know whether the trend in adoption of cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions we have experienced in the past will continue in the future. furthermore, if we or other saas security providers experience security incidents, loss or disclosure of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for saas solutions as a whole, including our security solutions, could be negatively affected. you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and evolving market. if we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services in response to rapid technological changes and market developments as well as evolving security threats, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed. our ability to increase revenue from existing customers and attract new customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to rapid technological changes and market developments as well as evolving security threats. the success of our falcon platform depends on our ability to take such changes into account and invest effectively in our research and development organization to increase the reliability, availability and scalability of our existing solutions and introduce new solutions. if we fail to effectively anticipate, identify or respond to such changes in a timely manner, or at all, our business could be harmed. even if we adequately fund our research and development efforts there is no guarantee that we will realize a return on such efforts. success in delivering enhancements and new solutions depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or new solution, the risk that such enhancement or new solution may have quality or other defects or deficiencies, especially in the early stages of introduction, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate sales capabilities in new markets. failure to effectively deliver, integrate, and manage perceptions with respect to enhancements and new solutions may erode our competitive position, significantly impair our revenue growth, and negatively impact our operating results. if we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed. to expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our falcon platform. our sales efforts often involve educating our prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our falcon platform. enterprises and governments that use legacy security products, such as signature-based or malware-based products, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and antivirus, for their it security may be hesitant to purchase our falcon platform if they believe that these products are more cost effective, provide substantially the same functionality as our falcon platform or provide a level of it security that is sufficient to meet their needs. we may have difficulty convincing prospective customers of the value of adopting our solution. even if we are successful in convincing prospective customers that a cloud native platform like ours is critical to protect against cyberattacks, they may not decide to purchase our falcon platform for a variety of reasons, some of which are out of our control. for example, any deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the geopolitical environment, the outbreak of diseases or other public health crises, volatility in the banking and financial services sector, or inflation (as well as government policies such as raising interest rates in response to inflation), have in the past and may in the future cause our current and prospective customers to delay or cut their overall security and it operations spending, and such delays or cuts may fall disproportionately on cloud-based security solutions like ours. economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on security and it operations may result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, an increase in multi-phase subscription start dates, shorter terms for customer subscriptions,"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"lengthened sales cycles, increased churn, lower demand for our products, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. furthermore, we may need to exercise more flexibility in customer payment terms as customers navigate a more challenging economic environment. additionally, if the incidence of cyberattacks were to decline, or be perceived to decline, or if organizations adopt endpoints that use operating systems we do not adequately support, our ability to attract new customers and expand sales of our solutions to existing customers could be adversely affected. if organizations do not continue to adopt our falcon platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products and add additional cloud modules to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed. in order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our falcon platform when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers by selling additional cloud modules and by deploying to more endpoints in their environments. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our falcon platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one year, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, customers that previously signed multi-year subscription contracts may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths, and customers may cease using certain cloud modules altogether. even if customers choose to renew their subscription of certain cloud modules, they may decline to purchase additional cloud modules or choose not to consolidate onto our falcon platform. our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solutions, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition and general economic and geopolitical conditions. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may materially suffer."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our falcon platform. customers often view the subscription to our falcon platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our falcon platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens and adds uncertainty to our sales cycle. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may lead to additional scrutiny of budgets by current and prospective customers, which has resulted in, for example, longer sales cycles for products and services, and may result in shifting demand for it products and services, and slower adoption of new technologies. our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the market for security and it operations solutions is intensely competitive, fragmented, and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and by frequent introductions of new or improved products or services to combat security threats. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: product capabilities, including performance and reliability, of our falcon platform, including our cloud modules, services, and features compared to those of our competitors;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to improve existing products, services, and features, or to develop new ones to address evolving customer needs; our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees; our ability to establish and maintain relationships with channel partners; the strength of our sales and marketing efforts; and acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors. our competitors include the following by general category: legacy antivirus product providers who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional signature-based anti-virus protection; alternative endpoint security providers who generally offer a mix of on-premise and cloud-hosted products that rely heavily on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques; network security vendors who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint or cloud security solutions; cloud security vendors, including those who focus on public cloud infrastructure and services; identify security vendors that seek to identify and secure user accounts and related activities; and professional service providers who offer cybersecurity response services. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do. further, they may have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, the provision of customer support, and the pursuit of acquisitions. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings as well as routes to market, which allows them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including our cloud modules. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, including with respect to ai. our competitors may more successfully incorporate ai into their products, gain or leverage superior access to certain ai technologies, and achieve higher market acceptance of their ai solutions. conditions in our market could also change rapidly and significantly due to partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. further, competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market quicker than we can or convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs. even if there is significant demand for cloud-based security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other security and it operations providers is more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding products from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. competitive pricing pressure may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results. if we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures or other factors, our margins will be reduced and our gross profits, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. the subscription prices for our falcon platform, cloud modules, and professional services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions by our competitors, or promotional programs offered by us or our competitors. the cybersecurity market remains very competitive, and competition may further increase in the future. competitors may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. if our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to detect or prevent incidents or have or are perceived to have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation would be harmed, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our falcon platform and cloud modules, the failure of our platform to detect or prevent incidents, including advanced and newly developed attacks, misconfiguration of our solutions, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our platform could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. because our cloud native security platform is complex, it may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. we cannot assure you that our products will detect all cyberattacks, especially in light of the rapidly changing security threat landscape that our solution seeks to address. due to a variety of both internal and external factors, including, without limitation, defects or misconfigurations of our or third-party solutions, our solutions could be or become vulnerable to security incidents (both from intentional attacks and accidental causes) that cause them to fail to secure endpoints and detect and block attacks. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and endpoints change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are affected. additionally, our falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist, which may lessen customers’ trust in our solutions. moreover, as our cloud native security platform is adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, individuals and organizations behind advanced cyberattacks may intensify their efforts to defeat our security platform. if this happens, our systems and subscription customers could be specifically targeted by attackers and could result in vulnerabilities in our platform or undermine the market acceptance of our falcon platform and could adversely affect our reputation as a provider of security solutions. because we host customer data on our cloud platform, which in some cases may contain personally-identifiable information or potentially confidential information, a security compromise, or an accidental or intentional misconfiguration or malfunction of our platform or third-party platforms could result in personally-identifiable information and other customer data being accessible such as to attackers or to other customers. further, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next-generation or cloud-based security system, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and cloud-based security solutions such as ours in particular. organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks, systems, and endpoints. no security solution, including our falcon platform, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. if any of our customers experiences a successful cyberattack while using our solutions or services, such customer could be disappointed with our falcon platform, regardless of whether our solutions or services blocked the theft of any of such customer’s data, if the customer failed to protect its own credentials, or if the attack would have otherwise been mitigated or prevented if the customer had fully deployed aspects of our falcon platform. similarly, if our solutions detect attacks against a customer but the customer does not address the vulnerability, customers and the public may erroneously believe that our solutions were not effective. security breaches against customers that use our solutions may result in customers and the public believing that our solutions failed. our falcon platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our falcon platform to reflect the increasing sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. real or perceived security breaches of our customers’ networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, and other customer relations issues, and may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. as a cybersecurity provider, we have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. if our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected. as a provider of security solutions, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities or to exploit our falcon platform as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. in particular, because we have been involved in the identification of organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we have been the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our systems. such efforts may also intensify as geopolitical tensions increase. we are also susceptible to inadvertent compromises of our systems and data, including those arising from process, coding, or human errors. moreover, we utilize third-party service providers to, among other things, host, transmit, or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain, operations, and communications. our third-party service providers and other vendors have faced and may continue to face cyberattacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents from a variety of sources. a successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service or that compromises our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property. we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such attacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data, or that of our third-party service providers and vendors. organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently. furthermore, employee error or malicious activity could compromise our systems. as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property including access to our source code, and information about vulnerabilities in our product, which in turn, could reduce the effectiveness of our solutions, or lead to cyberattacks or other intrusions of our customers’ networks, litigation, governmental audits and investigations and significant legal fees, any or all of which could damage our relationships with our existing customers and could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers. we have expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant resources in an effort to prevent security breaches and other security incidents impacting our systems and data. since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual or perceived security incident affecting our internal systems or data or data of our customers would be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution, and our business. in addition, while we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on third-party data centers, such as amazon web services, and our own colocation data centers to host and operate our falcon platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these facilities may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our falcon platform which could cause our business to suffer. our customers depend on the continuous availability of our falcon platform. we currently host our falcon platform and serve our customers using a mix of third-party data centers, primarily amazon web services, inc., or aws, and our data centers, hosted in colocation facilities. consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. we have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. the following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery, availability, and the performance of our falcon platform: the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet; the performance and availability of third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services, such as aws, with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services; decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events; cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, or the infrastructure of the internet; failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our data capacity requirements; errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including third-party software incorporated in our software; improper deployment or configuration of our solutions; the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; and the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. the adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. interruptions or failures in our service delivery could result in a cyberattack or other security threat to one of our customers during such periods of interruption or failure. additionally, interruptions or failures in our service could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, adversely affect our renewal rates, and harm our ability to attract new customers. our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that a cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solution is unreliable. while we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors. the occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to rapidly and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of george kurtz, our president and chief executive officer, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. we rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, research and development, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, our employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an “at-will” basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. in particular, they can cause operational and administrative inefficiencies, and could impact relationships with key customers and vendors. if mr. kurtz, or one or more of our key employees, or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business could be harmed."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed. there is also significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology, cyber, sales, professional services, and administrative support functions. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications and security software. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. additionally, our incident response and proactive services team is small and comprised of personnel with highly technical skills and experience, who are in high demand, and who would be difficult to replace. more generally, the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. also, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards, which may give them a substantial amount of personal wealth. this may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected. we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel, particularly in international markets. we have expanded our sales organization significantly in recent periods and expect to continue to add additional sales capabilities in the near term. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and this delay is accentuated by our long sales cycles. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. in addition, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations. our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our ability to attract new and retain existing customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers; economic difficulties confronting our customers, which may impact the number of modules or endpoint deployments they are willing or able to purchase; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions; the timing and length of our sales cycles; changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs; any disruption in our relationship with channel partners; changes in the growth rate of the cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions market; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors; decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our falcon platform; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our falcon platform; negative media coverage or publicity; our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; the amount and timing of operating costs (including new hires), tightening of labor markets and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes; increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices;"

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"political events, geopolitical unrest or tension, acts of war and terrorism. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the year due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. in addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, typically with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year. any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and technology alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our crowdstrike and falcon brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our falcon platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our falcon platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry or financial analysts and research firms often test our solutions and provide reviews of our falcon platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our falcon platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. additionally, the performance of our channel partners and technology alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile private and public customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks, which sometimes involve nation-state actors. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. changing political environments in the united states and abroad may amplify the media and political scrutiny we face. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our falcon platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our falcon platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed. in addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our channel partners to sell and support our falcon platform. the vast majority of sales of our falcon platform flow through our channel partners, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or technology alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our falcon platform. if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our solutions, or if we are unable to enter into"

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our international operations and plans for future international expansion expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely impact our business. we derived approximately 32%, 30%, and 28% of our total revenue from our international customers for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. we expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. these international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including: greater difficulty in negotiating contracts with standard terms, enforcing contracts and managing collections, and longer collection periods; higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations; management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion; risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification, and localization of our falcon platform that may be required in foreign countries; greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties; compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, or fcpa, the u.s. travel act and the u.k. bribery act 2010, or bribery act, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties, and collateral consequences for our company; heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements; the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets; foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the united states; political and economic instability in some countries; double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the united states or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements (including, but not limited to data localization requirements); requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities; greater difficulty identifying qualified channel partners and maintaining successful relationships with such partners; differing employment practices and labor relations issues; and difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations. additionally, nearly all of our sales contracts are currently denominated in u.s. dollars. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our international customers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states; is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the australian dollar, british pound, canadian dollar, euro, indian rupee, and japanese yen; and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. as we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, subject to budgetary uncertainty and typically involves long sales cycles. we have made significant investment to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. u.s. federal, state and local government sales as well as foreign government sales are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"sales to such government entities include, but are not limited to, the following risks: selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale; we may be required to obtain personnel security clearances and facility clearances to perform on classified contracts for government agencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain such clearances; government certification, software supply chain, or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our products are constantly evolving and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell to certain government customers until we have attained the new or revised certification or meet other applicable requirements, which we are not guaranteed to do. for example, although we are currently certified under the u.s. federal risk and authorization management program, or fedramp, such certification is costly to maintain and if we lose our certification it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers; government product requirements are often technically complex and assessors may require us to make costly changes to our products to meet such requirements without any assurance that such changes will generate a sale;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"government demand and payment for our falcon platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays in the government appropriations or procurement processes adversely affecting public sector demand for our falcon platform, including as a result of abrupt events such as war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics; government attitudes towards us as a company, our platform or the capabilities that we offer as a viable software solution may change, and reduce interest in our products and services as acceptable solutions; changes in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, can create uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and reduce available funding for our products and services; third parties may compete intensely with us on pending, new or existing contracts with government products, which can also lead to appeals, disputes, or litigation relating to government procurement, including but not limited to bid protests by unsuccessful bidders on potential or actual awards of contracts to us or our partners by the government;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"even if we are awarded a sale, the terms of such contracts may be unusually burdensome; governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our falcon platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities; and governments may require certain products to be manufactured, hosted, or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies. the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grow. as our customers gain more experience with our solutions, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our platform and services are being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"additionally, we have and will continue to make substantial investments to support growth at our data centers and improve the profitability of our cloud platform. for example, because of the importance of aws’ services to our business and aws’ position in the cloud-based server industry, any renegotiation or renewal of our agreement with aws may be on terms that are significantly less favorable to us than our current agreement. if our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with aws are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our falcon platform and in our ability to make our solutions available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits. in addition, we may be required to re-invest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers. we may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support. once our falcon platform is deployed within our customers’ networks, our customers depend on our customer support services to resolve any issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our falcon platform. if we do not provide effective ongoing support, customer renewals and our ability to sell additional modules as part of our falcon platform to existing customers could be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. many larger organizations have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller customers and we offer premium services for these customers. failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new solutions, which capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and which could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. retaining or expanding our current levels of personnel and product and service offerings may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or services and enhancements to our falcon platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products or services could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our class a common stock could decline. if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of our class a common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that further restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders. any of the above could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. we believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on building and marketing our falcon platform. as we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. additionally, our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. if we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our falcon platform, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform. supply chain disruptions could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network, replace defective equipment in our existing data centers and impact our operating costs. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform and provide services to our customers. we generally purchase these components on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over production costs and constraints based on the then current availability, terms and pricing of these components. if we experience disruption or delay from our suppliers, we may not be able to obtain supplies or components from alternative suppliers on a timely basis or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. the technology industry has experienced widespread component shortages and delivery delays, including as a result of geopolitical tensions, public health crises and natural disasters. while we have taken steps to mitigate our supply chain risk, supply chain disruptions and delays could nevertheless adversely impact our operations by, among other things, causing us to delay opening new data centers, delay increasing capacity or replacing defective equipment at existing data centers, and experience increased operating costs. risks related to intellectual property, legal, and regulatory matters the success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. we believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and abroad, all of which provide only limited protection. the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable. moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. we have filed for patents in the united states and in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. for example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and even if we do detect violations, litigation or technical changes to our products may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the united states. any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, which could harm our business and results of operations. further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. the inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business. a number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. as we face increasing competition and grow, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us also grows. in addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. from time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. as the number of products and competitors in the security and it operations market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. while we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. in addition, future litigation may involve non-practicing entities, companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, even a claim without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. additionally, our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims that may be made. in the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. if we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features while developing such technology. although third parties may offer a license to their technology or other intellectual property, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. in addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. if a third party does not offer us a license to its technology or other intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we could be enjoined from continued use of such intellectual property. as a result, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services, while developing such technology. furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services. any such judgment or settlement could also require us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations."

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. as a result, our margins, market share, and results of operations could be significantly harmed. we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. ensuring compliance with such requirements may increase operating costs, impact our data processing practices and policies and the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. in the united states, there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and data disposal laws. for example, at the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission (which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security), as well as the electronic communication privacy act, the computer fraud and abuse act, the health insurance portability and accountability act, and the gramm leach bliley act. the united states congress also has considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, various proposals for comprehensive federal data privacy and security legislation, to which we may become subject if passed. at the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act (collectively, the “ccpa”). the ccpa broadly defines personal information and gives california residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. the ccpa provides for severe civil penalties and statutory damages for violations and a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of unencrypted personal information. this private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. numerous other states have also enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations that share similarities with the ccpa. moreover, laws in all 50 u.s. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data privacy and security legal framework with which we must comply. for example, we are required to comply with the european union (“eu”) general data protection regulation (“gdpr”) and its equivalent in the u.k. (“u.k. gdpr”), which impose stringent obligations regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data. while the gdpr and u.k. gdpr remain substantially similar for the time being, the u.k. government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the gdpr. while these developments increase uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the u.k., even in their current, substantially similar form, the gdpr and u.k. gdpr can expose businesses to divergent parallel regimes that may be subject to potentially different interpretations and enforcement actions for certain violations and related uncertainty. failure to comply with the gdpr or the u.k. gdpr can result in significant fines and other liability, including, under the gdpr, fines of up to eur 20 million (or gbp 17.5 million under the u.k. gdpr) or four percent (4%) of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. european data protection authorities have already imposed fines for gdpr violations of up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of euros. legal developments in the european economic area (“eea”) have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states and other so-called third countries outside the eea, including in the context of website cookies. similar complexities and uncertainties also apply to transfers from the u.k. to third countries. while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses (“sccs”) and the u.k.’s international data transfer agreement (or the u.k.’s international data transfer addendum that can be used with the sccs), the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain. on july 10, 2023, the european commission adopted an adequacy decision concluding that the u.s. ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the eu to the u.s. under the recently adopted eu-u.s. data privacy framework (followed on october 12, 2023 with the adoption of an adequacy decision in the u.k. for the u.k.-u.s. data bridge); however, such new adequacy decision has been challenged in eu courts, and is likely to face additional challenges. moreover, although the u.k. currently has an adequacy decision from the european commission, such that sccs are not required for the transfer of personal data from the eea to the u.k., that decision will sunset in june 2025 unless extended and it may be revoked in the future by the european commission if the u.k. data protection regime is reformed in ways that deviate substantially from the gdpr. the eu has also proposed legislation that would regulate non-personal data and establish new cybersecurity standards, and other countries, including the u.k., may similarly do so in the future. if we are otherwise unable to transfer data, including personal data, between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. while we have implemented new controls and procedures designed to comply with the requirements of the gdpr, u.k. gdpr and the data privacy and security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data. moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. if our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information, whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the federal trade commission or applicable state attorneys general. our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). there also has been increased regulatory scrutiny from the sec with respect to adequately disclosing risks concerning cybersecurity and data privacy. such scrutiny from the sec increases the risk of investigations into the cybersecurity practices, and related disclosures, of companies within its jurisdiction. any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or negatively impact our ability to contract with customers, including those in the public sector. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing data protection, data privacy and data security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states. increased scrutiny of technologies like ai may also become subject to regulation under new laws or new applications of existing laws, such as the ai act being considered in the eu. noncompliance by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions; mandatory changes to our falcon platform; disgorgement of profits, fines and damages; civil and criminal penalties or injunctions; claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"termination of contracts; loss of intellectual property rights; loss of our license to do business in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and temporary or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we endeavor to properly classify employees as exempt versus non-exempt under applicable law. although there are no pending or threatened material claims or investigations against us asserting that some employees are improperly classified as exempt, the possibility exists that some of our current or former employees could have been incorrectly classified as exempt employees. these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with customers, including those in the public sector, could result in reduced sales of our products or services, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business, reputation, and results of operations. we are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our products, services and business activities, including our collection of information about cyber threats, are subject to various restrictions under u.s. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the u.s. commerce department’s export administration regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control. the u.s. export control laws and u.s. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or service or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our service in those countries. changes in our products or services or changes in these laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products or services into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or services globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products or services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our products or services or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products or services in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and monetary penalties. although we take precautions to prevent our products or services from being provided in violation of such laws, our products or services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. this could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and harm to our reputation. we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (“fcpa”), the u.k. bribery act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. as we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. in addition, we use channel partners, agents and other third-parties to sell our products or conduct business on our behalf. we or such third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and under certain circumstances we could be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of such partners, and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. we have implemented an anti-corruption compliance program but cannot ensure that all our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. noncompliance with the fcpa, other applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to investigations, whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, and other enforcement actions within the u.s. and internationally. any violation of these laws could result in disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts and other consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our falcon platform and subject us to possible litigation. our products and subscriptions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our falcon platform, and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims could result in litigation. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, discovering certain open source software code in our falcon platform, or a finding that we have breached the terms of an open source software license, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, by, among other things:"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation; diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business; requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; causing delays in the deployment of our falcon platform or service offerings to our customers; requiring us to stop offering certain services or features of our falcon platform; requiring us to redesign certain components of our falcon platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense; requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers. we utilize artificial intelligence, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business. we incorporate novel uses of ai technologies, including generative ai, into our products and operations. ai is complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. the introduction of ai into new or existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. for example, if we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content on which our ai technologies rely, we may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party. ai algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable. our customers or others may rely on or use this flawed content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. the use of ai presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. the technologies underlying ai and its uses are subject to a variety of laws, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws. ai is the subject of ongoing review by various u.s. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various u.s. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their cybersecurity and data protection laws to ai or are considering general legal frameworks for ai, such as the ai act currently being considered in the eu. as a fast-evolving and complicated technology subject to significant government attention, ai-related legislation and regulation may be developed and apply to ai in unexpected ways. we may not be able to anticipate how to respond to or comply with these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. furthermore, because ai technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of ai. we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer. certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our falcon platform. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our falcon platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our falcon platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheets for such commitments. our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers. we are currently, and may in the future become, involved in litigation that may adversely affect us. we are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations and other proceedings including patent, product liability, class action, whistleblower, personal injury, property damage, labor and employment (including allegations of wage and hour violations), commercial disputes, compliance with laws and regulatory requirements and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings as our business develops. such claims, suits, and government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition, and/or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products may harm our business and results of operations. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, these provisions do not cover our indemnification obligations and they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. the sale and support of our products also entails the risk of product liability claims. additionally, our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims regarding intellectual property infringement, breach of agreement, including confidentiality, privacy and security obligations, violation of applicable laws, damages caused by failures of our solutions or to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products and services, or other acts or omissions. these contractual provisions often survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. we have not to date received any indemnification claims from third parties. however, as we continue to grow, the possibility of these claims against us will increase. if our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees, and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our products and services, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or other claims, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. additionally, our falcon platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. for example, our falcon platform might be misused by a customer to monitor its employee’s activities in a manner that violates the employee’s privacy rights under applicable law. during the course of performing certain solution-related services and our professional services, our teams may have significant access to our customers’ networks. we cannot be sure that an employee may not take advantage of such access which may make our customers vulnerable to malicious activity by such employee. any such misuse of our falcon platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and results of operations. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we offer our falcon complete customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. while we maintain insurance relating to our warranty, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover such claims, that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any claim. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have paid the warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering this warranty which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment. we cannot predict the prices at which our class a common stock will trade. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights; announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to mr. kurtz;"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics; general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our class a common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock in the public market, including shares of class a stock that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. as of february 29, 2024, we had 229,383,465 shares of class a common stock outstanding and 12,485,193 shares of class b common stock outstanding. in addition, certain holders of our class b common stock are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the securities act pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement. if these holders of our class b common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our class a common stock. we may also issue our shares of class a common stock or securities convertible into shares of our class a common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our class a common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. in addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to the completion of our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. our class b common stock has 10 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors and the approval of any change in control transaction. future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. as of january 31, 2024, our executive officers, directors, one of our current stockholders and its respective affiliates held, in aggregate, 36% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control or other liquidity event of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale or other liquidity event and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply to accel, or its respective affiliates, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of our credit facility. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. certain provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management, and may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. these provisions include: our dual class common stock structure, which provides our holders of class b common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock; a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, which prohibition will take effect on the first date on which the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock represents less than 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock and our class b common stock, taken together as a single class; the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;"

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"general risk factors if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (“sarbanes-oxley act”), the rules and regulations of nasdaq, and other securities rules and regulations that impose various requirements on public companies. our management and other personnel devote substantial time and resources to comply with these rules and regulations. such compliance has increased, and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our consolidated financial statements and in the reports that we file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations, may result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could result in an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, and lead to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to, and issue an opinion on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our class a common stock to decline. any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our stock. future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services or technologies. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner in the future is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers or investors. in addition, our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or issues with employees or customers. if we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. we may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include: diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions; integration of administrative systems, employee, product and service offerings; retention of key employees from the acquired company; changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition; the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective

CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, (iii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or (iv) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (“oecd”) has published proposals covering a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules, tax treaties, and taxation of the digital economy. on october 8, 2021, the oecd/g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting (the “inclusive framework”) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform originally agreed on july 1, 2021, and a timetable for implementation by 2023. the timetable for implementation has since been extended to 2024 and, with respect to certain components of the plan, to 2025. under pillar one, a portion of the residual profits of multinational businesses with global turnover above €20 billion and a profit margin above 10% will be allocated to market jurisdictions where such allocated profits would be taxed. under pillar two, the inclusive framework has agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million, calculated on a jurisdictional basis. while substantial work remains to be completed by the oecd and national governments on the implementation of these proposals, future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. on february 1, 2023, the u.s. financial accounting standards board (""fasb"") indicated that they believe the minimum tax imposed under pillar two is an alternative minimum tax, and, accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. in addition, the oecd’s proposed solution envisages new international tax rules and the removal of all digital services taxes (“dst”). notwithstanding this, some countries, in the european union and beyond, continue to operate existing dst regimes to capture tax revenue on digital services more immediately. such laws may increase our tax obligations in those countries or change the manner in which we operate our business."
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate u.s. federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of $1.5 billion and $243.9 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for income tax purposes. the federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely, and california net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032. as of january 31, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards for other states of $0.8 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal 2025. as of january 31, 2024, we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of $113.9 million and $27.4 million, respectively. the federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036, and the california carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely. as of january 31, 2024, we had aggregate united kingdom net operating loss carryforwards of $78.0 million and israel net operating loss carryforwards of $51.5 million, which are carried forward indefinitely. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset u.s. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts,"
CRWD,2024-03-07,risk factors,"and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses; valuation of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants; carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets; loss contingencies; and the provision for income taxes and related deferred taxes. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we are subject to risks associated with our equity investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could adversely impact our financial results. through our falcon funds, we invest in early to late stage private companies, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize. these companies are often dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies in which we have invested could deteriorate, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies. in addition, our ability to realize gains on investments may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. for example, to the extent a company we have invested in undergoes an initial public offering, we may be subject to a lock-up agreement that restricts our ability to sell our securities for a period of time after the public offering or otherwise impedes our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities. further, valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. in addition, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our marketable equity investments, the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our non-marketable equity investments, and changes in the proportionate share of earnings and losses or impairment of our equity investments accounted for under the equity method. this volatility could be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline. expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. there is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (“esg”) matters, both in the united states and internationally. we have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake certain esg-related initiatives, goals and commitments, which we have communicated on our website, in our sec filings and elsewhere. these initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. we could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our esg-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. in addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. stakeholders could also challenge the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of our esg-related disclosures. our actual or perceived failure to achieve some or all of our esg-related initiatives, goals, or commitments or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations or regulatory requirements could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers and expose us to increased scrutiny from esg-focused investors, regulatory authorities and others, or subject us to liability. damage to our reputation or reduced demand for our products may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. our business is subject to the risks of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, natural events such as earthquakes, fire, floods, and the outbreak of diseases, as well as man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses or data security breaches. our principal executive offices are located in austin, texas, and we also maintain other office locations around the world, including in california and india, that are prone to natural disasters including severe weather and seismic activity. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or significant power outage and other catastrophic events, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as covid-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as public health crises, could affect our personnel, recovery of our assets, data centers, supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters. if our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of ai, and our internal systems may be victimized by such attacks. although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster, or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses we may incur. all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, or delays in the rendering of our services, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected."

2011, crowdstrike reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers. when we started crowdstrike, cyberattackers had an asymmetric advantage over legacy cybersecurity products that could not keep pace with the rapid changes in adversary tactics. we took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the ai-native crowdstrike falcon xdr platform – the first, true cloud-native platform built with ai at the core, capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent. we believe our approach has defined a new category called the security cloud, which has the power to transform the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. using cloud-scale ai, our security cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, devops, it assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. the more data that is fed into our falcon platform, the more intelligent our security cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide. our go-to-market strategy we sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules to organizations across multiple industries. we primarily sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners. our direct sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints. we have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. when customers deploy our falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and easily add additional cloud modules. once customers experience the benefits of our falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. we also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land-and-expand model. by segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers. we began as a solution for large enterprises, but the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform has enabled us to seamlessly offer our solution to customers of any size. we have expanded our sales focus to include any sized organization without the need to modify our falcon platform for small and medium sized businesses. a substantial majority of our customers purchase subscriptions with a term of one year. our subscriptions are generally priced on a per-endpoint and per-module basis. we recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription. we also generate revenue from our incident response and proactive professional services, which are generally priced on a time and materials basis. we view our professional services business primarily as an opportunity to cross-sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules. certain factors affecting our performance adoption of our solutions. we believe our future success depends in large part on the growth in the market for cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions. many organizations have not yet abandoned the on-premise legacy products in which they have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and maintain. as a result, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our cloud-based solutions. new customer acquisition. our future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire new customers. if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline. we believe that our go-to-market strategy and the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform allow us to rapidly expand our customer base. our incident response and proactive services also help drive new customer acquisitions, as many of these professional services customers subsequently purchase subscriptions to our falcon platform. many organizations have not yet adopted cloud-based security solutions, and since our falcon platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes, worldwide, and across industries, we believe this presents a significant opportunity for growth. maintain customer retention and increase sales. our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase the arr of their subscriptions. we focus on increasing sales to our existing customers by expanding their deployments to more endpoints and selling additional cloud modules for increased functionality. over time we have transitioned our platform from a single offering into highly-integrated offerings of multiple cloud modules. invest in growth. we believe that our market opportunity is large and requires us to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing efforts to further grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. our open cloud architecture and single data model have allowed us to rapidly build and deploy new cloud modules, and we expect to continue investing in those efforts to further enhance our technology platform and product functionality. in addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our falcon platform, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets. furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future given the additional expenses for accounting, compliance, and investor relations as we grow as a public company. key

CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"if we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed. to expand our customer base, we need to convince potential customers to allocate a portion of their discretionary budgets to purchase our falcon platform. our sales efforts often involve educating our prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our falcon platform. enterprises and governments that use legacy security products, such as signature-based or malware-based products, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and antivirus, for their it security may be hesitant to purchase our falcon platform if they believe that these products are more cost effective, provide substantially the same functionality as our falcon platform or provide a level of it security that is sufficient to meet their needs. we may have difficulty convincing prospective customers of the value of adopting our solution. even if we are successful in convincing prospective customers that a cloud native platform like ours is critical to protect against cyberattacks, they may not decide to purchase our falcon platform for a variety of reasons, some of which are out of our control. for example, any deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the geopolitical environment, the outbreak of diseases such as covid-19 or inflation (as well as government policies such as raising interest rates in response to inflation), have in the past and may in the future cause our current and prospective customers to delay or cut their overall security and it operations spending, and such delays or cuts may fall disproportionately on cloud-based security solutions like ours. economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on security and it operations may result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, an increase in multi-phase subscription start dates, shorter terms for customer subscriptions, lengthened sales cycles, increased churn, lower demand for our products, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. furthermore, we may need to exercise more flexibility in customer payment terms as customers navigate a more challenging economic environment. additionally, if the incidence of cyberattacks were to decline, or be perceived to decline, or if organizations adopt endpoints that use operating systems we do not adequately support, our ability to attract new customers and expand sales of our solutions to existing customers could be adversely affected. if organizations do not continue to adopt our falcon platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products and add additional cloud modules to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed. in order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our falcon platform when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers by selling additional cloud modules and by deploying to more endpoints in their environments. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our falcon platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one year, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, customers that previously signed multi-year subscription contracts may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths, and customers may cease using certain cloud modules altogether. even if customers choose to renew their subscription of certain cloud modules, they may decline to purchase additional cloud modules or choose not to consolidate onto our falcon platform."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our pricing, customer security and networking issues and requirements, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of endpoints to which our customers deploy our solutions, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers, industry developments, competition and general economic and geopolitical conditions. if our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may materially suffer."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. our revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our falcon platform. customers often view the subscription to our falcon platform as a significant strategic decision and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our falcon platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens and adds uncertainty to our sales cycle. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may lead to additional scrutiny of budgets by current and prospective customers, which has resulted in, for example, longer sales cycles for products and services, and may result in shifting demand for it products and services, and slower adoption of new technologies. our direct sales team develops relationships with our customers, and works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. we spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. as a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. the failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the market for security and it operations solutions is intensely competitive, fragmented, and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, increasingly sophisticated attackers, and by frequent introductions of new or improved products to combat security threats. we expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or reduced revenue growth, and loss of market share that would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: product capabilities, including performance and reliability, of our falcon platform, including our cloud modules, services, and features compared to those of our competitors; our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to improve existing products, services, and features, or to develop new ones to address evolving customer needs; our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees; our ability to establish and maintain relationships with channel partners; the strength of our sales and marketing efforts; and acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors. our competitors include the following by general category: legacy antivirus product providers who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional signature-based anti-virus protection; alternative endpoint security providers who generally offer a mix of on-premise and cloud-hosted products that rely heavily on malware-only or application whitelisting techniques;"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"network security vendors who are supplementing their core perimeter-based offerings with endpoint security solutions; and professional service providers who offer cybersecurity response services. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and a larger base of customers than we do. they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services than we can, and they may offer lower pricing than we do. further, they may have greater resources for research and development of new technologies, the provision of customer support, and the pursuit of acquisitions. our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings as well as routes to market, which allows them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including our cloud modules. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. some of our competitors have recently made acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. further, competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market quicker than we can or convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs. even if there is significant demand for cloud-based security solutions like ours, if our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of an organization’s it security architecture, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our platform. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other security and it operations providers is more limited than the functionality of our platform, organizations may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding products from additional vendors like us. if we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing or other actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"competitive pricing pressure may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our financial results. if we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures or other factors, our margins will be reduced and our gross profits, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. the subscription prices for our falcon platform, cloud modules, and professional services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions by our competitors, or promotional programs offered by us or our competitors. the cybersecurity market remains very competitive, and competition may further increase in the future. competitors may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. if our solutions fail or are perceived to fail to detect or prevent incidents or have or are perceived to have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation would be harmed, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our falcon platform and cloud modules, the failure of our platform to detect or prevent incidents, including advanced and newly developed attacks, misconfiguration of our solutions, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our platform could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. because our cloud native security platform is complex, it may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. we cannot assure you that our products will detect all cyberattacks, especially in light of the rapidly changing security threat landscape that our solution seeks to address. due to a variety of both internal and external factors, including, without limitation, defects or misconfigurations of our solutions, our solutions could be or become vulnerable to security incidents (both from intentional attacks and accidental causes) that cause them to fail to secure endpoints and detect and block attacks. in addition, because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and endpoints change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are affected. additionally, our falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist, which may lessen customers’ trust in our solutions."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"moreover, as our cloud native security platform is adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, individuals and organizations behind advanced cyberattacks may intensify their efforts to defeat our security platform. if this happens, our systems and subscription customers could be specifically targeted by attackers and could result in vulnerabilities in our platform or undermine the market acceptance of our falcon platform and could adversely affect our reputation as a provider of security solutions. because we host customer data on our cloud platform, which in some cases may contain personally-identifiable information or potentially confidential information, a security compromise, or an accidental or intentional misconfiguration or malfunction of our platform could result in personally-identifiable information and other customer data being accessible such as to attackers or to other customers. further, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next-generation or cloud-based security system, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and cloud-based security solutions such as ours in particular. organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks, systems, and endpoints. no security solution, including our falcon platform, can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. if any of our customers experiences a successful cyberattack while using our solutions or services, such customer could be disappointed with our falcon platform, regardless of whether our solutions or services blocked the theft of any of such customer’s data, or if the attack would have otherwise been mitigated or prevented if the customer had fully deployed aspects of our falcon platform. similarly, if our solutions detect attacks against a customer but the customer does not address the vulnerability, customers and the public may erroneously believe that our solutions were not effective. security breaches against customers that use our solutions may result in customers and the public believing that our solutions failed. our falcon platform may fail to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our falcon platform to reflect the increasing sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. real or perceived security breaches of our customers’ networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, and other customer relations issues, and may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. as a cybersecurity provider, we have been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks. if our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected. as a provider of security solutions, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, specifically targeted by bad actors for attacks intended to circumvent our security capabilities or to exploit our falcon platform as an entry point into customers’ endpoints, networks, or systems. in particular, because we have been involved in the identification of organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we have been the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our systems. such efforts may also intensify if geopolitical tensions increase. we are also susceptible to inadvertent compromises of our systems and data, including those arising from process, coding, or human errors. we also utilize third-party service providers to, among other things, host, transmit, or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain, operations, and communications. our third-party service providers and other vendors have faced and may continue to face cyberattacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents from a variety of sources. a successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service or that compromises our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property. we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk, including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting, mitigating, and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table-top exercises, testing of our security protocols through additional techniques, such as penetration testing, debriefing after security incidents, to improve our security and responses, and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks, preparedness, and management, will be effective in protecting us from such attacks. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such attacks, compromises, interruptions in service, or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data, or that of our third-party service providers and vendors. organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently. furthermore, employee error or malicious activity could compromise our systems. as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property including access to our source code, and information about vulnerabilities in our product, which in turn, could reduce the effectiveness of our solutions, or lead to cyberattacks or other intrusions of our customers’ networks, litigation, governmental audits and investigations and significant legal fees, any or all of which could damage our relationships with our existing customers and could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers. we have expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant resources in an effort to prevent security breaches and other security incidents impacting our systems and data. since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual or perceived security incident affecting our internal systems or data or data of our customers would be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution, and our business. in addition, while we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on third-party data centers, such as amazon web services, and our own colocation data centers to host and operate our falcon platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these facilities may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our falcon platform which could cause our business to suffer. our customers depend on the continuous availability of our falcon platform. we currently host our falcon platform and serve our customers using a mix of third-party data centers, primarily amazon web services, inc., or aws, and our data centers, hosted in colocation facilities. consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. we have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"the following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery, availability, and the performance of our falcon platform: the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet; the performance and availability of third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services, such as aws, with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services; decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed to terminate our contracts, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties; physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events; cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, or the infrastructure of the internet; failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our data capacity requirements; errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including third-party software incorporated in our software; improper deployment or configuration of our solutions; the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; and the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"the adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. interruptions or failures in our service delivery could result in a cyberattack or other security threat to one of our customers during such periods of interruption or failure. additionally, interruptions or failures in our service could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, adversely affect our renewal rates, and harm our ability to attract new customers. our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that a cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solution is unreliable. while we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors. the occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to rapidly and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. in particular, we are highly dependent on the services of george kurtz, our president and chief executive officer, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. we rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, research and development, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions. although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, our employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an “at-will” basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. in particular, they can cause operational and administrative inefficiencies, and could impact relationships with key customers and vendors. if mr. kurtz, or one or more of our key employees, or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service, our business could be harmed."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed. there is also significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology, cyber, sales, professional services, and administrative support functions. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications and security software. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. for example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. additionally, our incident response and proactive services team is small and comprised of personnel with highly technical skills and experience, who are in high demand, and who would be difficult to replace. more generally, the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees’ inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. also, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards, which may give them a substantial amount of personal wealth. this may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected. we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel, particularly in international markets. we have expanded our sales organization significantly in recent periods and expect to continue to add additional sales capabilities in the near term. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and this delay is accentuated by our long sales cycles. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. in addition, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year. as a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations. our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our ability to attract new and retain existing customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of customers; economic difficulties confronting our customers, which may impact the number of modules or endpoint deployments they are willing or able to purchase; the timing and length of our sales cycles; changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs; changes in the growth rate of the cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions market; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments, including consolidation among our customers or competitors; the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyberattacks, and the market adoption of our falcon platform;"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; any disruption in our relationship with channel partners; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with or interruptions to, the use of our falcon platform; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices; negative media coverage or publicity; political events; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business; increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and significant natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as covid-19. furthermore, our business and revenues are impacted by global economic and geopolitical conditions. volatile financial markets, inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain challenges, political turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets continue to add uncertainty to macroeconomic conditions. any continued or further uncertainty, weakness or deterioration in economic conditions or the geopolitical environment could harm our business and results of operations. in addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers, as well as renewal orders from existing customers, in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the year due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers. in addition, we also experience seasonality in our operating margin, typically with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year. any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations from period to period. as a result of this variability, our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. moreover, this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. if we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our crowdstrike and falcon brand and our reputation as a provider of high-efficacy security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers, channel partners, and technology alliance partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. the successful promotion of our crowdstrike and falcon brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our falcon platform, our ability to successfully differentiate our falcon platform from competitive cloud-based or legacy security solutions and, ultimately, our ability to detect and stop breaches. although we believe it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry or financial analysts and research firms often test our solutions and provide reviews of our falcon platform, as well as the products of our competitors, and perception of our falcon platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected. our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may or may not be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments. to the extent potential customers, industry analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our solutions or services do not provide significant value, we may lose customers, and our reputation, financial condition and business would be harmed. additionally, the performance of our channel partners and technology alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners. in addition, we have in the past worked, and continue to work, with high profile private and public customers as well as assist in analyzing and remediating high profile cyberattacks, which sometimes involve nation-state actors. our work with such customers has exposed us to publicity and media coverage. changing political environments in the united states and abroad may amplify the media and political scrutiny we face. negative publicity about us, including about our management, the efficacy and reliability of our falcon platform, our products offerings, our professional services, and the customers we work with, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and brand. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our falcon platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed. in addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our channel partners to sell and support our falcon platform. the vast majority of sales of our falcon platform flow through our channel partners, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. additionally, we have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. the loss of a substantial number of our channel partners or technology alliance partners, or the failure to recruit additional partners, could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners and in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our falcon platform. if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our solutions, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of, high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell solutions and keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and results of operations will be harmed."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our international operations and plans for future international expansion expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely impact our business. we derived approximately 30%, 28%, and 28% of our total revenue from our international customers for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. we are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. we expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. these international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including: greater difficulty in negotiating contracts with standard terms, enforcing contracts and managing collections, and longer collection periods; higher costs of doing business internationally, including costs incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations; management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion; risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including any importation, certification, and localization of our falcon platform that may be required in foreign countries; greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties; compliance with anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, or fcpa, the u.s. travel act and the u.k. bribery act 2010, or bribery act, violations of which could lead to significant fines, penalties, and collateral consequences for our company;"

CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets; foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the united states; political and economic instability in some countries; double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the united states or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements (including, but not limited to data localization requirements); requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance; greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities; greater difficulty identifying qualified channel partners and maintaining successful relationships with such partners; differing employment practices and labor relations issues; and difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations. additionally, nearly all of our sales contracts are currently denominated in u.s. dollars. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our international customers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states; is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the australian dollar, british pound, canadian dollar, euro, indian rupee, and japanese yen; and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. as we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business. our business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our future growth depends, in part, on increasing sales to government organizations. demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, subject to budgetary uncertainty and typically involves long sales cycles. we have made significant investment to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. u.s. federal, state and local government sales as well as foreign government sales are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"sales to such government entities include, but are not limited to, the following risks: selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale; we may be required to obtain personnel security clearances and facility clearances to perform on classified contracts for government agencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain such clearances; government certification, software supply chain, or source code transparency requirements applicable to us or our products are constantly evolving and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell to certain government customers until we have attained the new or revised certification or meet other applicable requirements, which we are not guaranteed to do. for example, although we are currently certified under the u.s. federal risk and authorization management program, or fedramp, such certification is costly to maintain and if we lose our certification it would restrict our ability to sell to government customers; government product requirements are often technically complex and assessors may require us to make costly changes to our products to meet such requirements without any assurance that such changes will generate a sale; government demand and payment for our falcon platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays in the government appropriations or procurement processes adversely affecting public sector demand for our falcon platform, including as a result of abrupt events such as war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics; government attitudes towards us as a company, our platform or the capabilities that we offer as a viable software solution may change, and reduce interest in our products and services as acceptable solutions; changes in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, can create uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and reduce available funding for our products and services; third parties may compete intensely with us on pending, new or existing contracts with government products, which can also lead to appeals, disputes, or litigation relating to government procurement, including but not limited to bid protests by unsuccessful bidders on potential or actual awards of contracts to us or our partners by the government;"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"even if we are awarded a sale, the terms of such contracts may be unusually burdensome; governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our falcon platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations, or institute fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities; and governments may require certain products to be manufactured, hosted, or accessed solely in their country or in other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products to governmental agencies. the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"we may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements. our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the needs of new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers as their use of our solutions grow. as our customers gain more experience with our solutions, the number of endpoints and events, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our platform and services are being accessed, have in the past, and may in the future, expand rapidly. in order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our service and cloud infrastructure operations. these technologies, which include databases, applications and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new and untested. we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. in addition, it takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. to the extent that we do not effectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our growing customer base and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. additionally, we have and will continue to make substantial investments to support growth at our data centers and improve the profitability of our cloud platform. for example, because of the importance of aws’ services to our business and aws’ position in the cloud-based server industry, any renegotiation or renewal of our agreement with aws may be on terms that are significantly less favorable to us than our current agreement. if our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with aws are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our falcon platform and in our ability to make our solutions available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield the expected savings in operating costs or the expected performance benefits. in addition, we may be required to re-invest any cost savings achieved from prior cloud infrastructure improvements in future infrastructure projects to maintain the levels of service required by our customers. we may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support. once our falcon platform is deployed within our customers’ networks, our customers depend on our customer support services to resolve any issues relating to the implementation and maintenance of our falcon platform. if we do not provide effective ongoing support, customer renewals and our ability to sell additional modules as part of our falcon platform to existing customers could be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. many larger organizations have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller customers and we offer premium services for these customers. failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new solutions, which capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and which could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. retaining or expanding our current levels of personnel and products offerings may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products and enhancements to our falcon platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business. accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our class a common stock could decline. if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of our class a common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that further restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders. any of the above could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"if we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. we believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on building and marketing our falcon platform. as we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. additionally, our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. if we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our falcon platform, all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"public health crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, operating results and future revenue. we are subject to public health crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic, which has impacted and continues to impact worldwide economic activity and financial markets. we have previously taken and may in the future take precautionary measures intended to mitigate the spread of the covid-19 virus and minimize the risk to our employees, customers, partners, and the communities in which we operate to respond to developments relating to the pandemic, including developments relating to infection rates, disease variants, vaccination progress and efficacy, and evolving public health guidance. these measures could, for example, negatively affect our customer success efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, impact our sales and marketing efforts, slow our international expansion efforts, increase cybersecurity risks, and create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. in addition, public health crises may disrupt the operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time. some of our customers have been negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, which could result in delays in accounts receivable collection, or result in decreased technology spending which could negatively affect our revenues. more generally, the covid-19 pandemic adversely affected economies and financial markets globally. uncertainty caused by public health crises could lead to prolonged economic downturns, which could result in a larger customer churn than we can anticipate and reduce demand for our products and services, in which case our revenues could be significantly impacted. the lasting impact of the public health crises, including the covid-19 pandemic, may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform. supply chain disruptions could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network, replace defective equipment in our existing data centers and impact our operating costs. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform and provide services to our customers. we generally purchase these components on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over production costs and constraints based on the then current availability, terms and pricing of these components. if we experience disruption or delay from our suppliers, we may not be able to obtain supplies or components from alternative suppliers on a timely basis or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. the technology industry has recently experienced widespread component shortages and delivery delays, including as a result of geopolitical tensions, the covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters. while we have taken steps to mitigate our supply chain risk, supply chain disruptions and delays could nevertheless adversely impact our operations by, among other things, causing us to delay opening new data centers, delay increasing capacity or replacing defective equipment at existing data centers, and experience increased operating costs."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"risks related to intellectual property, legal, and regulatory matters the success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. we believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and abroad, all of which provide only limited protection. the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents may be held invalid or unenforceable. moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. we have filed for patents in the united states and in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. for example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and even if we do detect violations, litigation or technical changes to our products may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the united states. any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, which could harm our business and results of operations. further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. the inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business. a number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. for example, in march 2022, webroot, inc. and open text, inc. filed a lawsuit against us alleging that certain of our products infringe on patents held by them. as we face increasing competition and grow, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us also grows. in addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. from time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. as the number of products and competitors in the security and it operations market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. while we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. in addition, future litigation may involve non-practicing entities, companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party, even a claim without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. additionally, our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims that may be made. in the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. if we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features while developing such technology. although third parties may offer a license to their technology or other intellectual property, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. in addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. if a third party does not offer us a license to its technology or other intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we could be enjoined from continued use of such intellectual property. as a result, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. additionally, we may be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services, while developing such technology. furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services. any such judgment or settlement could also require us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business. we currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our solutions. we cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our falcon platform. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. if we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell solutions and services containing or dependent on that technology would be limited, and our business could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this could limit or delay our ability to offer new or competitive solutions and increase our costs. as a result, our margins, market share, and results of operations could be significantly harmed. we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. we are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security. ensuring that our collection, use, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information complies with such requirements can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. in the united states, there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and data disposal laws. for example, at the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission (which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security), as well as the electronic communication privacy act, the computer fraud and abuse act, the health insurance portability and accountability act, and the gramm leach bliley act. the united states congress also has considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, various proposals for comprehensive federal data privacy and security legislation, to which we may become subject if passed. if we are found to have violated applicable laws or regulations, we also may be subject to penalties, fines, damages, injunctions or other outcomes that may adversely affect our operations and financial results. at the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act (collectively, the “ccpa”). the ccpa broadly defines personal information and gives california residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. the ccpa also prohibits covered businesses"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"from discriminating against california residents for exercising any of their ccpa rights. the ccpa provides for severe civil penalties and statutory damages for violations and a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of unencrypted personal information. this private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. numerous other states have also enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations that share similarities with the ccpa. at least four such laws, in virginia, colorado, connecticut, and utah, have taken effect, or are scheduled to take effect, in 2023. moreover, laws in all 50 u.s. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. these state statutes, and other similar state or federal laws that may be enacted in the future, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data privacy and security legal framework with which we must comply. for example, we are required to comply with the european union (“eu”) general data protection regulation (“gdpr”), which imposes stringent obligations regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data. additionally, following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu, we also are subject to the u.k. general data protection regulation (“u.k. gdpr”), a version of the gdpr as implemented into the laws of the united kingdom (“u.k.”). while the gdpr and u.k. gdpr remain substantially similar for the time being, the u.k. government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the gdpr. while these developments increase uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the u.k., even in their current, substantially similar form, the gdpr and u.k. gdpr can expose businesses to divergent parallel regimes that may be subject to potentially different interpretations and enforcement actions for certain violations and related uncertainty. failure to comply with the gdpr or the u.k. gdpr can result in significant fines and other liability, including, under the gdpr, fines of up to eur 20 million (or gbp 17.5 million under the u.k. gdpr) or four percent (4%) of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. the cost of compliance, and the potential for fines and penalties for non-compliance, with gdpr and u.k. gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations. legal developments in the european economic area (“eea”), including recent rulings from the court of justice of the european union (“cjeu”) and from various eu member state data protection authorities, have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states and other so-called third countries outside the eea, including in the context of website cookies. similar complexities and uncertainties also apply to transfers from the u.k. to third countries. while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as implementing the european commission’s standard contractual clauses (“sccs”), the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain. moreover, in 2021, the european commission adopted new sccs, which impose on companies additional obligations relating to personal data transfers out of the eea, including the obligation to update internal privacy practices, conduct transfer impact assessments and, as required, implement additional security measures. the new sccs may increase the legal risks and liabilities under eu laws associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in material increased compliance and operational costs. while the european commission announced in march 2022 that an agreement in principle had been reached between eu and u.s. authorities regarding a new transatlantic data privacy framework, no formal agreement has been finalized, and any such agreement, if formalized, is likely to face challenge at the cjeu. moreover, although the u.k. currently has an adequacy decision from the european commission, such that sccs are not required for the transfer of personal data from the eea to the u.k., that decision will sunset in june 2025 unless extended and it may be revoked in the future by the european commission if the u.k. data protection regime is reformed in ways that deviate substantially from the gdpr. adding further complexity for international data flows, in march 2022, the u.k. adopted its own international data transfer agreement (“idta”) for transfers of personal data out of the u.k. to so-called third countries, as well as an international data transfer addendum (u.k. addendum) that can be used with the sccs for the same purpose. the eu has also proposed legislation that would regulate non-personal data and establish new cybersecurity standards, and other countries, including the u.k., may similarly do so in the future. if we are otherwise unable to transfer data, including personal data, between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. while we have implemented new controls and procedures designed to comply with the requirements of the gdpr, u.k. gdpr and the data privacy and security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data. moreover, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security. although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. if our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information, whether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the federal trade commission or applicable state attorneys general. our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or negatively impact our ability to contract with customers, including those in the public sector. our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing data protection, data privacy and data security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states. noncompliance by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions; mandatory changes to our falcon platform; disgorgement of profits, fines and damages; civil and criminal penalties or injunctions; claims for damages by our customers or channel partners; termination of contracts; loss of intellectual property rights; loss of our license to do business in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and temporary or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we endeavor to properly classify employees as exempt versus non-exempt under applicable law. although there are no pending or threatened material claims or investigations against us asserting that some employees are improperly classified as exempt, the possibility exists that some of our current or former employees could have been incorrectly classified as exempt employees."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with customers, including those in the public sector, could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business, reputation, and results of operations. we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions, and anti-corruption laws, that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. we are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export controls, that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in our markets. our products are subject to u.s. export controls, including the u.s. department of commerce’s export administration regulations, and we and our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties are also subject to various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. treasury department’s office of foreign assets control. we incorporate standard encryption algorithms into our products, which, along with the underlying technology, may be exported outside of the u.s. only with the required export authorizations, including by license, license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, which may require the filing of an encryption registration and classification request. furthermore, u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain cloud-based solutions to countries, governments, and persons targeted by u.s. sanctions. we also collect information about cyber threats from open sources, intermediaries, and third parties, which we use and make available to our customers in our threat industry publications. although we take precautions and have implemented certain procedures to prevent our information collection practices and services from being provided in violation of applicable laws and regulations, our information collection practices and services may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided in violation of such laws and regulations. in addition, we cannot assure you that third parties, many of whom we do not control, have complied with all such laws or regulations. failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with such laws and regulations in the collection of this information could adversely affect us, through reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, government investigations, and civil and criminal penalties. various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we are also subject to the fcpa, the bribery act, and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the united states and other countries in which we conduct activities. anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. we leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents, and channel partners, to conduct our business in the u.s. and abroad, to sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and to collect information about cyber threats. we and these third-parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties, even if we do not authorize such activities. while we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa, the bribery act and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties have taken, or will not take actions, in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. as we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. any investigations, actions or sanctions could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"some of our technology incorporates “open source” software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our falcon platform and subject us to possible litigation. our products and subscriptions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions. the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code and they can change the license terms on which they offer the open source software. many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. in addition, the wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public, including authorizing further modification and redistribution, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which could provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions, require us to re-engineer all or a portion of our falcon platform, and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products and subscriptions incorporating such software. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective. from time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. these claims could result in litigation. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, discovering certain open source software code in our falcon platform, or a finding that we have breached the terms of an open source software license, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, by, among other things: resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation; diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business; requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; causing delays in the deployment of our falcon platform or service offerings to our customers; requiring us to stop offering certain services or features of our falcon platform; requiring us to redesign certain components of our falcon platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense; requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"we provide service level commitments under some of our customer contracts. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer. certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our falcon platform. any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our falcon platform and the availability of services to customers. if we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our falcon platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. to date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheets for such commitments. our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"we are currently, and may in the future become, involved in litigation that may adversely affect us. we are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations and other proceedings including patent, product liability, class action, whistleblower, personal injury, property damage, labor and employment (including allegations of wage and hour violations), commercial disputes, compliance with laws and regulatory requirements and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings as our business develops. such claims, suits, and government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs and diversion of management attention and resources, and could cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, adversely affect our brand recognition, and/or require us to change our business practices. the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. these proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects from real or perceived defects in our solutions or their misuse by our customers or third parties and indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our solutions. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products may harm our business and results of operations. although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our terms and conditions of sale, these provisions do not cover our indemnification obligations as described in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—indemnification” and they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. the sale and support of our products also entails the risk of product liability claims. additionally, our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims regarding intellectual property infringement, breach of agreement, including confidentiality, privacy and security obligations, violation of applicable laws, damages caused by failures of our solutions or to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products and services, or other acts or omissions. these contractual provisions often survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. we have not to date received any indemnification claims from third parties. however, as we continue to grow, the possibility of these claims against us will increase. if our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, license fees, and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party’s rights. we may also have to seek a license for the technology. such license may not"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions or features. we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our products and services, which could harm our business. large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or other claims, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. additionally, our falcon platform may be used by our customers and other third parties who obtain access to our solutions for purposes other than for which our platform was intended. for example, our falcon platform might be misused by a customer to monitor its employee’s activities in a manner that violates the employee’s privacy rights under applicable law. during the course of performing certain solution-related services and our professional services, our teams may have significant access to our customers’ networks. we cannot be sure that an employee may not take advantage of such access which may make our customers vulnerable to malicious activity by such employee. any such misuse of our falcon platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, which could result in harm to our business, reputation, and results of operations. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and harm our business and reputation. we offer our falcon complete customers a limited warranty, subject to certain conditions. while we maintain insurance relating to our warranty, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover such claims, that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any claim. any failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have paid the warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense or cause us to cease offering this warranty which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, expose us to liability claims by our customers, negatively impact our sales and marketing efforts, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment. we cannot predict the prices at which our class a common stock will trade. the market price of our class a common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “risk factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our class a common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our class a common stock include the following:"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights; announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to mr. kurtz; effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as covid-19; general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our class a common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. sales of substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our class a common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock in the public market, including shares of class a stock that have been converted from shares of class b common stock, and particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. as of february 28, 2023, we had 222,937,242 shares of class a common stock outstanding and 12,926,743 shares of class b common stock outstanding. in addition, certain holders of our class b common stock are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the securities act pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement. if these holders of our class b common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our class a common stock. we may also issue our shares of class a common stock or securities convertible into shares of our class a common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline. if industry or financial analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our class a common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our class a common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. if any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. in addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. if our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our class a common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to the completion of our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. our class b common stock has 10 votes per share, and our class a common stock has one vote per share. the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock (or options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock) prior to our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors and the approval of any change in control transaction. future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term. as of january 31, 2023, our executive officers, directors, one of our current stockholders and its respective affiliates held, in aggregate, 38% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control or other liquidity event of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale or other liquidity event and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply to accel, or its respective affiliates, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our class a common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of our credit facility. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. certain provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management, and may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. these provisions include: our dual class common stock structure, which provides our holders of class b common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock; a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, which prohibition will take effect on the first date on which the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock represents less than 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock and our class b common stock, taken together as a single class; the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock; and advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. these provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware, and to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the united states, will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine. however, this exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act. in addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the united states will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the state of delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. as of january 31, 2023, we had $750.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (excluding intercompany indebtedness), and there is additional availability under our revolving facility of up to $750.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; requiring a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; and exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving facility, are at variable rates of interest; and increasing our cost of borrowing. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the senior notes, depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. the terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that governs the senior notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. in addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. in the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. further, our credit agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our revolving facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. if we breach the covenants under our debt instruments, we would be in default under such instruments. the holders of such indebtedness could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain terms which restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:"

CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our revolving facility and the indenture that governs our senior notes contain cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. a breach of the covenants under our revolving facility or the indenture that governs our senior notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. in addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving facility would permit the lenders under our revolving facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness. general risk factors if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (“sarbanes-oxley act”), the rules and regulations of nasdaq, and other securities rules and regulations that impose various requirements on public companies. our management and other personnel devote substantial time and resources to comply with these rules and regulations. such compliance has increased, and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our consolidated financial statements and in the reports that we file with the sec is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. our current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. additionally, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of internal controls and we may uncover new deficiencies. weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations, may result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and could result in an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, and lead to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to, and issue an opinion on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our class a common stock to decline. any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our stock. future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. as part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services or technologies. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, services or technologies in a successful manner in the future is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers or investors. in addition, our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or issues with employees or customers. if we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. we may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our class a common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"additional risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include: diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions; integration of administrative systems, employee, product and service offerings; retention of key employees from the acquired company; changes in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition; the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies; additional legal, regulatory or compliance requirements; financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we do not adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect; liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations. we are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business in international markets. we generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the united states, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. we are subject to federal, state, and local income, sales, and other taxes in the united states and income, withholding, transaction, and other taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. in addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected, among other things, by (i) changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including increases in corporate tax rates and greater taxation of international income and changes relating to income tax nexus, (ii) recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, (iii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or (iv) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. we may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (“oecd”) has published proposals covering a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules, tax treaties and taxation of the digital economy. a significant majority of countries in the oecd’s inclusive framework have agreed in principle to a proposed solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, including joining a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation rules and ensure that multinational enterprises pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate. the first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between countries for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with global revenue above 20 billion euro and certain other criteria. the second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent applicable to in-scope multinational enterprises and is intended to apply to multinational enterprises with annual consolidated group revenue in excess of 750 million euro. while substantial work remains to be completed by the oecd and national governments on the implementation of these proposals, future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. the oecd’s proposed solution envisages new international tax rules and the removal of all digital services taxes (“dst”). notwithstanding this, some countries, in the european union and beyond, continue to operate a dst regime to capture tax revenue on digital services more immediately. such laws may increase our tax obligations in those countries or change the manner in which we operate our business."
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. as of january 31, 2023, we had aggregate u.s. federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of $1.6 billion and $248.2 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income for income tax purposes. if not utilized, the federal and california net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2031. as of january 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards for other states of $1.0 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal 2024. as of january 31, 2023, we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of $87.4 million and $18.8 million, respectively. the federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2035, and the california carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely. as of january 31, 2023, we had aggregate united kingdom net operating loss carryforwards of $80.9 million, which are carried forward indefinitely. realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. as a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use"
CRWD,2023-03-09,risk factors,"our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset u.s. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. if we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses; valuation of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants; carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets; loss contingencies; and the provision for income taxes and related deferred taxes. additionally, as a result of the global covid-19 pandemic, many of management’s estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our class a common stock. additionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we are subject to risks associated with our equity investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could adversely impact our financial results. through our falcon funds, we invest in early to late stage private companies, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize. these companies are often dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies in which we have invested could deteriorate, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies. in addition, our ability to realize gains on investments may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. for example, to the extent a company we have invested in undergoes an initial public offering, we may be subject to a lock-up agreement that restricts our ability to sell our securities for a period of time after the public offering or otherwise impedes our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities. further, valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. in addition, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our marketable equity investments, the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our non-marketable equity investments, and changes in the proportionate share of earnings and losses or impairment of our equity investments accounted for under the equity method. this volatility could be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline. our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, outbreak of diseases and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism. our principal executive offices are located in austin, texas, and we also maintain other office locations around the world, including in california and india, that are prone to natural disasters including severe weather and seismic activity. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or significant power outage and other catastrophic events, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as covid-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as covid-19, could affect our personnel, recovery of our assets, data centers, supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters. in the event that our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and our internal systems may be victimized by such attacks. although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses we may incur. acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or customers or the economy as a whole. any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected."

and analysis. our fiscal years ended january 31, 2023, january 31, 2022, and january 31, 2021, are referred to herein as fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. overview founded in 2011, crowdstrike reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers. when we started crowdstrike, cyberattackers had an asymmetric advantage over legacy cybersecurity products that could not keep pace with the rapid changes in adversary tactics. we took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the crowdstrike falcon platform – the first, true cloud-native platform capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent. our pioneering platform approach keeps customers ahead of attackers by automatically detecting and preventing threats to stop breaches. we believe our approach has defined a new category called the security cloud, which has the power to transform the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. using cloud-scale ai, our security cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, devops, it assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. the more data that is fed into our falcon platform, the more intelligent our security cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide. our go-to-market strategy we sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules to organizations across multiple industries. we primarily sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules through our direct sales team that leverages our network of channel partners. our direct sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales professionals who are segmented by a customer’s number of endpoints. we have a low friction land-and-expand sales strategy. when customers deploy our falcon platform, they can start with any number of cloud modules and easily add additional cloud modules. once customers experience the benefits of our falcon platform, they often expand their adoption over time by adding more endpoints or purchasing additional modules. we also use our sales team to identify current customers who may be interested in free trials of additional cloud modules, which serves as a powerful driver of our land-and-expand model. by segmenting our sales teams, we can deploy a low-touch sales model that efficiently identifies prospective customers. we began as a solution for large enterprises, but the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform has enabled us to seamlessly offer our solution to customers of any size. we have expanded our sales focus to include any sized organization without the need to modify our falcon platform for small and medium sized businesses. a substantial majority of our customers purchase subscriptions with a term of one year. our subscriptions are generally priced on a per-endpoint and per-module basis. we recognize revenue from our subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription. we also generate revenue from our incident response and proactive professional services, which are generally priced on a time and materials basis. we view our professional services business primarily as an opportunity to cross-sell subscriptions to our falcon platform and cloud modules. certain factors affecting our performance adoption of our solutions. we believe our future success depends in large part on the growth in the market for cloud-based saas-delivered endpoint security solutions. many organizations have not yet abandoned the on-premise legacy products in which they have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and maintain. as a result, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our cloud-based solutions. new customer acquisition. our future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire new customers. if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline. we believe that our go-to-market strategy and the flexibility and scalability of our falcon platform allow us to rapidly expand our customer base. our incident response and proactive services also help drive new customer acquisitions, as many of these professional services customers subsequently purchase subscriptions to our falcon platform. many organizations have not yet adopted cloud-based security solutions, and since our falcon platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes, worldwide, and across industries, we believe this presents a significant opportunity for growth. maintain customer retention and increase sales. our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase the arr of their subscriptions. we focus on increasing sales to our existing customers by expanding their deployments to more endpoints and selling additional cloud modules for increased functionality. over time we have transitioned our platform from a single offering into highly-integrated offerings of multiple cloud modules. invest in growth. we believe that our market opportunity is large and requires us to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing efforts to further grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. our open cloud architecture and single data model have allowed us to rapidly build and deploy new cloud modules, and we expect to continue investing in those efforts to further enhance our technology platform and product functionality. in addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our falcon platform, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets. furthermore, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future given the additional expenses for accounting, compliance, and investor relations as we grow as a public company. key metrics we monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions."
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"subscription customers we define a subscription customer as a separate legal entity that has entered into a distinct subscription agreement for access to falcon platform for which the term has not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract. we do not consider our channel partners as customers, and we treat managed service security providers, who may purchase our products on behalf of multiple companies, as a single customer. while initially we focused our sales and marketing efforts on large enterprises, in recent years we have also increased our sales and marketing to small and medium sized businesses."
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,the following table sets forth the number of our subscription customers as of the dates presented:
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"as of january 31, 2023 2022 subscription customers 23,019 16,325 year-over-year growth 41 % 65 %"
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"we added 6,694 net new subscription customers during fiscal 2023, for a total of 23,019 subscription customers as of january 31, 2023, representing 41% growth year-over-year. we added 6,429 net new subscription customers during fiscal 2022 for a total of 16,325 subscription customers as of january 31, 2022, representing 65% growth year-over-year. given our initiatives to grow customers served through our managed service security provider partners, which are not included in our subscription customer metrics, and to move further down-market, as well as the growing number of smaller end customers that we serve, which tend to contribute significantly less arr on a per customer basis when compared to larger enterprises, we believe that our subscription customer metric no longer provides valuable insight into the performance of our business. as a result, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will no longer provide a number of subscription customers as a key metric on which to evaluate the strength of our business. annual recurring revenue (“arr”) arr is calculated as the annualized value of our customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. to the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, we continue to include that revenue in arr if we are actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies us that it is not renewing its subscription."

CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"dollar-based net retention rate our dollar-based net retention rate compares our arr from a set of subscription customers against the same metric for those subscription customers from the prior year. our dollar-based net retention rate reflects customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn, and excludes revenue from our incident response and proactive services. we calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of period end by starting with the arr from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or prior period arr. we then calculate the arr from these same subscription customers as of the current period end, or current period arr. current period arr includes any expansion and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing 12 months but excludes revenue from new subscription customers in the current period. we then divide the current period arr by the prior period arr to arrive at our dollar-based net retention rate. our dollar-based net retention rate was above 120% throughout fiscal years 2023 and 2022. our dollar-based net retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in a given period, which may reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in subsequent periods if the customer makes a larger upfront purchase and does not continue to increase purchases."

CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"our dollar-based net retention rate has varied from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, and we expect that trend to continue. in addition, we have seen strong success with our strategy to land bigger deals with more modules, and we are also seeing an acceleration in our acquisition of new customers. while we view these two trends as positive developments, they have a natural trade off on our ability to expand business with existing customers in the near term."

CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,components of our results of operations
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"revenue subscription revenue. subscription revenue primarily consists of subscription fees for our falcon platform and additional cloud modules that are supported by our cloud-based platform. subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscription customers, the number of endpoints per customer, and the number of cloud modules included in the subscription. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one to three years. because the majority of our subscription customers are billed upfront, we have recorded significant deferred revenue. consequently, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions that we entered into during previous periods. the majority of our customers are invoiced annually in advance or multi-year in advance. professional services revenue. professional services revenue includes incident response and proactive services, forensic and malware analysis, and attribution analysis. professional services are generally sold separately from subscriptions to our falcon platform, although customers frequently enter into a separate arrangement to purchase subscriptions to our falcon platform at the conclusion of a professional services arrangement. professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, one-time and ongoing engagements, and retainer-based agreements. for time and materials and retainer-based arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed. fixed fee contracts account for an immaterial portion of our revenue. cost of revenue subscription cost of revenue. subscription cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to hosting our cloud-based falcon platform in data centers, amortization of our capitalized internal-use software, employee-related costs such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees, property and equipment depreciation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs. as new customers subscribe to our platform and existing subscription customers increase the number of endpoints on our falcon platform, our cost of revenue will increase due to greater cloud hosting costs related to powering new cloud modules and the incremental costs for storing additional data collected for such cloud modules and employee-related costs. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud platform and our customer support organizations as we grow our business. the level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. professional services cost of revenue. professional services cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related costs, such as salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, technology, property and equipment depreciation, and an allocated portion of facilities and administrative costs. gross profit and gross margin gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new subscription customers, renewals from existing subscription customers, sales of additional modules to existing subscription customers, the data center and bandwidth costs associated with operating our cloud platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support and cloud operations organizations, and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology, infrastructure, and data centers through technological improvements. we expect our gross profit to increase in dollar amount and our gross margin to increase modestly over the long term, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. demand for our incident response services is driven by the number of breaches experienced by non-customers. also, we view our professional services solutions in the context of our larger business and as a significant lead generator for new subscriptions. because of these factors, our services revenue and gross margin may fluctuate over time. operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general administrative expenses. for each of these categories of expense, employee-related expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, employee bonuses, sales commissions, and employer payroll tax. operating expenses also include an allocated portion of overhead costs for facilities and it. sales and marketing. sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, and bonuses. sales and marketing expenses also include stock-based compensation; expenses related to our fal.con customer conference and other marketing events; an allocated portion of facilities and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired intangibles, and cloud hosting and related services costs related to proof of value efforts. sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and any other incremental payments made upon the initial acquisition of a subscription or upsells to existing customers, which are capitalized and amortized over the estimated customer life. we also capitalize and amortize any such expenses paid for the renewal of a subscription over the term of the renewal. we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount as we continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenue, further penetrate the market, and expand our global customer base. however, we anticipate sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period-to-period depending on the timing of these expenses. research and development. research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses such as salaries and bonuses;

CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"indemnification our subscription agreements contain standard indemnification obligations. pursuant to these agreements, we will indemnify, defend, and hold the other party harmless with respect to a claim, suit, or proceeding brought against the other party by a third party alleging that our intellectual property infringes upon the intellectual property of the third party, or results from a breach of our representations and warranties or covenants, or that results from any acts of negligence or willful misconduct. the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual after the execution of the agreement. typically, these indemnification provisions do not provide for a maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make. however, in the past we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our consolidated balance sheets as of january 31, 2023 or january 31, 2022. we also agreed to indemnify our directors and certain executive officers for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited. however, our director and officer liability insurance policy mitigates our exposure. historically, we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our consolidated balance sheets as of january 31, 2023 or january 31, 2022. critical accounting policies and estimates our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. see note 1, description of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10-k. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of factors affecting our business and our belief as to what could occur in the future considering available information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the accounting estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained, and our operating environment changes. changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and, if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. by their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these estimates."
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below."
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"revenue recognition we derive our revenue predominately from subscription revenue, which is primarily based on the solutions subscribed to by the customer. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. our professional services are available through time and material and fixed fee agreements. revenue from professional services is recognized as services are performed. we enter into revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations in which a customer may purchase combinations of subscriptions, support, training, and consulting service. judgment is required when considering the terms and conditions of these contracts. the transaction price for these contracts is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“ssp”) basis. the ssp is the price at which we would sell promised subscription or professional services separately to a customer."
CRWD,2023-03-09,managements discussion,"business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangibles assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected customer attrition rates, estimated obsolescence rates, and discount rates. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. we account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we establish a liability for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service (“irs”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, description of business and significant accounting policies, included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information about the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements."
